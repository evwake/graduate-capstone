GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham and the Seattle Seahawks added to their history of success in Arizona with a 22-16 victory over the Cardinals on Thursday night.
The Seahawks (6-3) limited Adrian Peterson to 29 yards in 21 carries in a game marred by a host of injuries and penalties, most of them against Seattle, to improve to 4-0-1 in Arizona in Bruce Arians' five seasons as coach of the Cardinals (4-5).
Seattle's Kam Chancellor forced a fumble by Peterson on Arizona's first offensive play and later tackled him in the end zone for a safety.
