TAMPA, Fla. --  Devonta Freeman rushed for 126 yards and a touchdown to help the Atlanta Falcons stay close in the tight NFC South race with a 24-21 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night.
Freeman scored on a 32-yard run midway through the fourth quarter, restoring a 10-point lead for the Falcons (8-5), who then barely hung on to win for the fifth time in six games and remain one game behind New Orleans and Carolina in the division standings.
Freeman also caught five passes for a team-high 68 yards and had a first-half fumble recovered in the end zone by teammate Levine Toilolo for a touchdown. Matt Ryan threw an early TD pass to Justin Hardy and finished 17 of 31 passing for 212 yards and no interceptions.
Jameis Winston threw for 299 yards and three TDs for the Bucs (4-10), including a 16-yarder to Adam Humphries that trimmed Atlanta's lead to 24-21 with 3:51 remaining.
Winston, who also threw TD passes of 30 yards to O.J. Howard and 42 yards to Mike Evans, got the ball back with a minute left and nearly sent the game into overtime.
The third-year pro completed three straight passes to move the ball from his 29 to the Atlanta 36. Patrick Murray came on to try a 54-yard field goal to tie it, but the kick sailed wide right as time expired.
The Falcons play at New Orleans next Sunday, then close the regular season at home against Carolina -- the two teams they're chasing in the division race.
The Bucs have lost nine of 11 following a 2-1 start, taking a step back after finishing 9-7 a year ago in their first season under coach Dirk Koetter.
Gruden was fired after the 2008 season and moved into the broadcast booth the following season. The Bucs haven't made the playoffs since 2007 and don't have a postseason win since their Super Bowl run 15 years ago.
