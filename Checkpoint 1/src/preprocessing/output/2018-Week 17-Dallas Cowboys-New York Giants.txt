EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --  Don't tell Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys their regular-season finale against the New York Giants was a meaningless game.
Prescott threw a 32-yard fourth-down touchdown pass to Cole Beasley on a play that was reversed by video replay and added a winning 2-point conversion pass to Michael Gallup with 1:12 to play as the NFC East champion Cowboys rallied twice in the final 10 minutes to beat the New York Giants 36-35 on Sunday.
 Prescott said after going 27 of 44 for 387 yards and a season-high four touchdowns, three to tight end Blake Jarwin. 
The win was the seventh in eight games for the Cowboys and it has them looking forward to next weekend's wild-card game at home.
Dallas coach Jason Garrett downplayed the meaningless angle, even though he rested NFL leading rusher Ezekiel Elliott and two of his top offensive linemen.
For the Giants (5-11), it was another late loss. They lost eight games by seven points or less in Pat Shurmur's first season, the last two by a total of two points.
This also could have been quarterback Eli Manning's final start for them after a 15-year career. He has a year left on a four-year contract but his salary will count $23 million against the cap next season.
The soon-to-be 38 year old who is not very mobile still loves to play, but New York has made the playoffs once since winning the Super Bowl in February 2012.
 said Manning who went 24 of 41 for 301 yards and two touchdowns. 
Saquon Barkley capped a record-setting rookie season with a sensational 2-yard touchdown dive with 3:21 to play to put the Giants ahead 35-28
However, Prescott engineered a nine-play, 70-yard drive that he ended with an arching pass to Beasley in the back of the end zone. There was no doubt he caught the ball, and a review showed he got his knee down in bounds.
Barkley finished with 109 yards rushing and 142 yards from scrimmage. He ended the season with 91 catches, breaking Reggie Bush's NFL record (88) for most receptions by a rookie running back. The No. 2 overall pick also finished with 2,028 yards from scrimmage,  joining Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson (2,212 yards in 1983) and Edgerrin James (2,139 in 1999) as the only rookies with at least 2,000 scrimmage yards in NFL history.
Prescott hit Jarwin on scoring passes of 13, 19 and 39 yards. His 49-yard pass set up Rod Smith's 1-yard TD run.
Manning had TD passes of 21 yards to Cody Latimer and 6 to Evan Engram, who also caught a 2-point conversion pass. Wayne Gallman added a 2-yard TD run and Aldrick Rosas kicked two field goals.
Elliott won the NFL rushing title with 1,434 yards. Barkley finished second with 1,307 and Todd Gurley, who like Elliott did not play Sunday, dropped to third with 1,251 yards. Barkley's 142 yards from scrimmage allowed him to lead the league. Elliott finished second with 2,001 and Christian McCaffrey of the Panthers was third with 1,965.
Jarwin's TD catches were his first three in the NFL. ... Giants LB Olivier Vernon had 2 1/2 sacks and six QB hits. ... Dallas CB Chidobe Awuzie had an end-zone interception on the Giants' opening drive. Dallas' DeMarcus Lawrence had a strip-sack that fellow lineman Antwaun Woods recovered. ... Giants LB B.J. Goodson recovered Amari Cooper's fumble caused by DL Kerry Wynn.
