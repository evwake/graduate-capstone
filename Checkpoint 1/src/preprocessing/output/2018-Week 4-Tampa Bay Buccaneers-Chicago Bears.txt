CHICAGO --  Mitchell Trubisky threw a career-high six touchdown passes -- one shy of the NFL record -- and the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears pounded the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-10 on Sunday.
He finished one TD pass short of the franchise mark set by Sid Luckman against the New York Giants in 1943. Luckman is tied with seven others in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game. The Bears also racked up 483 yards in this one, nearly matching their record of 488 in that same game, on the way to their highest point total since 51-20 victory over Tennessee in 2012.
Trubisky had never thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game. But he threw for five in the first half alone as Chicago grabbed a 38-3 lead. The only other player with more in a single half since 1991 was Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers with six in the first two quarters against the Bears in a romp at Lambeau Field in November 2014.
Trubisky had no trouble finding wide-open receivers against a struggling secondary, completing 19 of 26 passes for 354 yards.
Khalil Mack had a strip-sack in the first half against Fitzpatrick. That made him the first player with a sack and forced fumble in four straight games since Robert Mathis for Indianapolis in 2005. He also appeared to tip the ball as Winston released a pass that Danny Trevathan picked off on the first drive of the second half.
Coming off a tight loss to Pittsburgh on Monday night, the Buccaneers (2-2) were simply overwhelmed in this one.
But after becoming the first player in NFL history to top 400 yards passing in three consecutive games, he was 9 of 18 for 126 yards and got sacked two times. Winston was 16 for 20 with 145 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
Chicago's Tarik Cohen had a career-high 121 yards receiving and a touchdown. Taylor Gabriel had a personal-best 104 yards receiving to go with two TD catches.
Trey Burton caught a 39-yard touchdown on the game's opening drive and finished with 86 yards.
Allen Robinson caught a 14-yarder late in the first quarter -- his first TD since signing with Chicago in the offseason.
