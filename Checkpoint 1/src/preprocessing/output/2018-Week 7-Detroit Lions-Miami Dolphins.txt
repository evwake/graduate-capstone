Unfazed by the weather, Kerryon Johnson rushed for 158 yards and the Lions netted 248 on the ground, their highest total in 21 years, to win 32-21.
Matt Stafford was 18 for 22 for 217 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit had 457 total yards and mounted scoring drives covering 64, 85, 75, 65, 75, 63 and 44 yards.
The Lions (3-3) punted once and had no turnovers to win on the road for the first time. They've climbed back to .500 after being outscored 78-44 in their first two games.
The Lions, meanwhile, held up well in the 88-degree sunshine, even though it was 40 degrees warmer than in Detroit. That was in contrast to the Chicago Bears, who wilted at Miami in an overtime loss a week earlier.
Johnson carried 19 times and needed barely a quarter to reach 100 yards. The rookie ran for 24 on Detroit's first play and found a gaping hole on a draw for a 71-yard gain, the Lions' longest running play since 2011, to set up a field goal.
Detroit averaged 7.1 yards per rush. Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake, for one, was surprised how many yards rushing his team allowed.
Detroit's Michael Roberts, who had missed the past three games with a knee injury, caught touchdown passes of 15 and 4 yards.
Brock Osweiler threw for 239 yards for the Dolphins, and after falling behind 20-7, they tried to rally with Kenyan Drake's 54-yard touchdown run and Danny Amendola's 24-yard scoring reception.
But Prater's 50-yard field goal -- his fourth -- with 1:55 left sealed the victory.
A security guard hurt her shoulder when Stills blindsided her on a scoring play . Stills' momentum carried him into the guard after he caught a 5-yard pass in the corner of the end zone, and the woman tumbled to the ground.
Miami: Wilson left the game in the second quarter after his foot appeared to buckle when he was tackled on a 25-yard reception. He limped to the locker room.
Stills and Wilson kneeled during the anthem, as they have done before previous games, and Miami defensive end Robert Quinn again raised his right fist.
Lions: Detroit plays at home Sunday against Seattle. It's their first meeting since the Seahawks beat the Lions in an NFC wild-card game two seasons ago.
