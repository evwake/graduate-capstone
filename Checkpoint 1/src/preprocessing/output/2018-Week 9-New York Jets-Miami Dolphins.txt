MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. --  Jerome Baker danced, waved, waggled his index finger and clicked his heels. For a first-year linebacker, it was a surprisingly polished touchdown celebration.
Baker bested fellow rookie Sam Darnold, scoring the game's only TD on a 25-yard interception return with 11 minutes left, and a resilient defense helped the Miami Dolphins beat the hapless New York Jets 13-6 on Sunday.
Darnold threw four interceptions and took four sacks, and the Jets went 2 for 15 on third and fourth down.
The quality of the opposition helped the defense dominate, however, allowing Miami to win with only seven first downs.
Darnold tried to rally the sputtering Jets (3-6) from a 6-3 deficit, but following a punt the rookie took a high snap and made an ill-advised throw to tight end Eric Tomlinson. Baker stepped in front for his first career interception and scored untouched.
T.J. McDonald and Walt Aikens made interceptions to end the Jets' final two possessions.
Miami broke a two-game losing streak and won for only the second time in the past six games. Gase improved to 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins this year.
Darnold went 21 for 39 for 229 yards and a passer rating of 31.8. He came into the game tied for the NFL lead with 10 interceptions , and the four picks were a new high.
Cameron Wake and Akeem Spence had two sacks apiece for the Dolphins, who had allowed 102 points the previous three weeks.
Miami totaled only 168 yards, but Brock Osweiler improved to 2-2 as a starter filling in for the injured Ryan Tannehill . Osweiler went 15 for 24 for 139 yards and took four sacks, but his unit committed no turnovers.
The field looked worn but was not an issue less than 24 hours after the Miami Hurricanes and Duke played on it in a downpour.
