MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. --  The Buffalo Bills showed again they can beat a bad team, which won’t help them in the playoffs.
Josh Allen tied a career high with three touchdown passes and ran for another score Sunday to help Buffalo complete a season sweep of the Miami Dolphins by winning 37-20.
The victory gave the Bills (7-3) their best 10-game record since 1999. But a recent regression -- they had lost two of their past three games -- and a soft schedule has left doubts about whether they deserve to make the postseason for only the second time in 20 years.
Through Week 10, Buffalo’s wins had come against opponents with a combined record of 12-44.
 said John Brown, who caught two touchdown passes. 
Miami was unable to extend a modest a two-game winning streak and lost to Buffalo for the fifth time in the past six meetings.
 said the Dolphins’ Ryan Fitzpatrick, who threw for 323 yards.
Allen’s TD tosses covered 40 and 9 yards to Brown, and 23 yards to Dawson Knox. Allen also scored on an 8-yard run, and he had a 36-yard run to set up a field goal.
Miami couldn’t keep up against Buffalo’s smothering front. The Bills totaled a season-high seven sacks and allowed only 23 yards rushing.
Allen went 21 for 33 for 256 yards without a sack or turnover, and his passer rating of 117.7 was a career high. He extended his streak of passes without an interception to 163.
Brown totaled 137 yards receiving, the most by a Buffalo player in nearly three years, on nine catches. The Bills netted a season-best 424 yards, and their point total was also a season high.
The Bills scored on their first four possessions to take a 16-0 lead, and at that point they enjoyed a 211-24 advantage in total yards.
Jakeem Grant scored for the Dolphins on a 101-yard kickoff return -- his fourth career kick or punt return for a score. Grant also scored on a 7-yard run on a jet sweep.
DeVante Parker set up Miami’s first touchdown by turning a short pass into a 50-yard gain.
Kicker Jason Sanders recovered. But on the next play, receiver Allen Hurns lost a fumble at the Buffalo 25.
South Florida native Devin Singletary, who rushed for 75 yards, estimated he had about 100 friends and relatives at the game. Bills colors filled several sections of the stadium.
