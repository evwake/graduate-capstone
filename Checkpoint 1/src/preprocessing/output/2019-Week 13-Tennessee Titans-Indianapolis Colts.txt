Cruikshank raced through an inside gap to block a potential tiebreaking field goal late in the fourth quarter and Smith returned it 63 yards for the go-ahead touchdown to send the Titans past Indianapolis 31-17.
The ramifications go far deeper than just another win, though.
By snapping a three-game losing streak against the Colts, Tennessee (7-5) moved one game in front of its AFC South rival, evened the season series and has the same number of division losses as Indy. All of those could factor into tiebreaking scenarios.
The Titans have now blocked three kicks in three weeks and forced three more turnovers Sunday to help them score the final 24 points.
Derrick Henry had 26 carries for 149 yards and scored on a 13-yard TD run on fourth down to cut the deficit to 17-14 in the third quarter.
Tannehill wound up 17 of 22 with 182 yards and two TDs -- sealing the victory with a 40-yard TD strike to Kalif Raymond with 3:02 to go, exactly two minutes after Smith's score.
This time, it wasn't just the offense. Jacoby Brissett was 25 of 40 with 319 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and he couldn't generate any points over the final 25 minutes while Vinatieri missed three field goals in all. Vinatieri has missed 14 kicks -- eight field goals and six extra points this season.
