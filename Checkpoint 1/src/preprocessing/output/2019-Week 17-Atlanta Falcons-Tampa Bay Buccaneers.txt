TAMPA, Fla. --  Dan Quinn and the Atlanta Falcons can hardly wait to get started again.
 Quinn said Sunday after the Falcons rallied to close the season with a 28-22 overtime victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Deion Jones intercepted Jameis Winston on the first play of overtime and returned the ball 27 yards for a touchdown to give Atlanta its sixth win in eight games, as well as a second-place finish in the NFC South.
Winston became the first Tampa Bay quarterback to pass for 5,000 yards in a season, but another non-playoff year for the Bucs ended on a sour note.
The Falcons (7-9) kicked two field goals in the final 6:27 of regulation, including a 33-yarder as time expired, to send it to the extra period.
Ryan completed 30 of 51 passes for 313 yards and one touchdown for the Falcons. In addition to forcing three turnovers that led to nine points, the Atlanta defense held Tampa Bay scoreless in the second half.
Winston threw for 201 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, hiking his NFL-leading total to 30. Ronald Jones II had the first 100-yard rushing performance and Breshad Perriman topped 100 yards receiving for the third straight week for the Bucs (7-9), who are missing the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year.
Ryan only got the Falcons into the end zone once, throwing a 35-yard TD pass to a wide-open Ty Sambrailo, a 6-foot-5, 311-pound backup offensive tackle. Younghoe Koo kicked field goals of 27, 33, 45, 42 and 33 yards, while his Bucs counterpart, Matt Gay, was 0 for 3 on field goal attempts.
Winston began the day leading the NFL in passing yards and finished with 5,109 yards and 33 touchdowns -- both franchise single-season records. He threw TD passes of 2 yards to Cameron Brate and 24 yards to Perriman to help the Bucs escape an early 10-0 hole.
Perriman, who stepped up in the absence of injured Pro Bowl receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, had five catches for 134 yards. Jones rushed for 106 yards on 11 attempts.
Meanwhile, linebacker Shaquil Barrett had three of Tampa Bay's six sacks of Ryan. Jason Pierre-Paul had two and forced a second-quarter fumble that rookie Devin White returned 91 yards for a TD that gave the Bucs a 14-13 lead.
Barrett, who had 19 1/2 sacks after signing a one-year, $4 million contract in free agency, broke Hall of Famer Warren Sapp's Tampa Bay single-season record of 16 1/2.
Buccaneers: Godwin was inactive for the second straight week with a hamstring injury, finishing the season with career highs of 86 receptions for 1,333 yards and nine touchdowns. ... Cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting left in the second quarter with an ankle injury and did not return. ...Defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches (foot) left in the third quarter and did not return.
