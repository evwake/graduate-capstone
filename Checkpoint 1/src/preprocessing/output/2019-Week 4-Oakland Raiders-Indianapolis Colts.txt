Carr led the Raiders to touchdowns on three of their first four drives, and safety Eric Harris returned a late interception 30 yards for a touchdown to secure a 31-24 victory at Indianapolis.
Carr delivered on a day he was 21 of 31 with 189 yards and two TDs.
He threw an 18-yard TD pass to Foster Moreau on the game's opening drive. On the Raiders' next offensive play, receiver Trevor Davis scooted around the left side and sprinted 60 yards for a touchdown to make it 14-0 less than seven minutes into the game.
After the Colts (2-2) converted a botched handoff into a 5-yard touchdown pass, Carr went back to work and connected with Tyrell Williams on a 19-yard TD pass for a 21-7 lead.
But what coach Jon Gruden liked most was Oakland's second-half start -- a 16-play drive that consumed 9:12 and ended with a short field goal to give the Raiders a 24-10 lead.
Indy (2-2), meanwhile, looked lethargic with starting receivers T.Y. Hilton and Devin Funchess out with injuries. The Colts gained 346 yards, more than half in the fourth quarter when they were scrambling to get back in the game.
Still, the Colts had chances. Brissett's a 4-yard TD pass to Chester Rogers with 5:27 to go got the Colts within 24-17. Even after Harris' interception , Brissett again made it a one-score game with a 48-yard TD pass to Eric Ebron with 1:10 remaining.
Brissett was 24 of 46 with 265 yards, three TDs and one interception.
