Allen's numbers weren't overwhelming -- 12 of 20 for 193 yards -- but his addition to the offense was dazzling.
That's when Scangarello busted out a direct snap to running back Phillip Lindsay, whose 16-yard gain for the first down sealed the win and was every bit as impressive as his 40-yard scamper that set up a first-half field goal or his 30-yard TD run in the third quarter.
Allen threw two TDs -- a 21-yard pass to Courtland Sutton and a 75-yarder to rookie tight end Noah Fant -- in his first start since the 2016 Liberty Bowl. He hadn't worked with either teammate until Wednesday.
Allen said he was amped up at the start but finally settled down when Sutton saved him by pulling down his poorly thrown pass over cornerback Denzel Ward for the game's first score.
Denver took a 17-12 halftime lead by holding Cleveland to four field goals after the Browns stalled at the Denver 21, 12, 9 and 13.
Twice the Broncos denied the Browns on fourth down in the second half.
Linebacker Todd Davis stuffed Mayfield on a keeper on fourth-and-inches at the Denver 5-yard line late in the third quarter, and Cleveland coach Freddie Kitchens lost a challenge on the call.
After that, Allen directed a 95-yard touchdown drive with Lindsay taking it in from 30 yards out to make it 24-12.
The Browns pulled to 24-19 on Jarvis Landry's 9-yard TD catch after a debatable pass interference on a third-down incompletion gave Mayfield a new set of downs inside the 10.
The Browns reached Denver's 28 with 3:23 left and called their last timeout before Kareem Jackson and Davontae Harris broke up Mayfield's pass to Landry on fourth-and-4.
