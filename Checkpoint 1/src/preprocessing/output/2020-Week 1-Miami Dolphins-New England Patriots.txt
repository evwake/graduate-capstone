Newton looked just fine as Tom Brady's replacement, rushing for two touchdowns Sunday, and the Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins 21-11 to open the season.
Newton rushed for 15 times for 75 yards and threw for 155 yards, leading a Patriots offensive attack that did most of its damage via the rushing game in their first game since the departure of Brady to Tampa Bay as a free agent.
Newton's 75 yards were the most by a Patriots quarterback since Steve Grogan had 81 in 1977.
Sony Michel added a touchdown for New England, which had 217 of its 357 yards on the ground. Newton was 15 of 19 passing.
Ryan Fitzpatrick was 20 of 30 for 191 yards and three interceptions. Miami was held to 269 total yards.
Newton scored from 11 yards early in the third quarter to put New England up 14-3. Late in the period, Jerome Baker kept the Dolphins in the game, stripping N'Keal Harry inside the 5-yard line, causing a fumble through the end zone for a touchback.
Miami then cut New England's lead to 14-11 in the fourth quarter on a 1-yard TD run by Jordan Howard  and 2-point conversion run by Fitzpatrick with 10:31 left.
The Patriots went quickly on their ensuing series and moved inside Miami's 40, thanks to a 23-yard run by Julian Edelman and 15-yard penalty on Baker for a late hit. Newton muscled inside the 1 on a fourth-and-1 draw play. Michel went over the top for a TD on the next play.
Newton carried on the second play of the game and capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run on the Patriots' third possession to put them up 7-0. The 2015 league MVP was untouched as he crossed into the end zone on the play, spiking the ball and flexing as he was surrounded by teammates.
As promised in a video released by the team on Friday, the Dolphins exited the field prior to the pregame playing of  about a half-hour before kickoff. Miami remained in the locker room during the national anthem, following through on a pledge the team made in its video.
Edelman pulled in 6-yard pass early in the second quarter, his 600th career reception. He is now second in franchise history behind only Wes Welker (672).
