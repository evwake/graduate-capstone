Instead, the team that won just one game last year looked just as bad — if not worse — as it did last season in a 37-21 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday.
Lawrence, the former Clemson standout, became the first rookie quarterback to start an opener in franchise history. It was a bumpy debut during which he threw for 332 yards and three touchdowns but also tossed three interceptions, often overthrew open receivers and was the victim of several drops.
Lawrence added that it was the first time he'd thrown three interceptions in a game at any level of football.
He brushed off a question about how tough Sunday’s loss was for him.
The Texans built a 14-0 lead before Lawrence put together a nice drive and capped it with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Chris Manhertz to cut the lead to 7 early in the second quarter.
Meyer recalled his thoughts after that touchdown.
Jacksonville’s next drive was a mess, with a penalty for having 12 men on the field on second down before Lawrence was picked off again. Vernon Hargreaves ran the interception back 18 yards to give Houston the ball at the Jacksonville 7.
The Texans cashed in on the miscue with a 26-yard field goal to extend the lead to 20-7 with about a minute left in the first half.
Houston tacked on another touchdown before halftime and with such a huge deficit in the second half the Jaguars had to all but abandon the run as they tried to catch up.
While certainly disappointed by his team’s poor showing in the opener, Meyer, who never lost more than two games in a season in seven years at Ohio State, is confident his team will bounce back from the loss.
