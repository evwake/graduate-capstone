The Rams had a 14-7 lead against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers early in the third quarter when they faced third-and-10 at the LA 25. McVay dialed up the perfect play that would be the defining moment in the Rams' 34-24 victory over the defending Super Bowl champions.
McVay called for a pass to DeSean Jackson on a go route. Jackson easily ran by cornerback Carlton Davis III, caught it at the Buccaneers 30 and then zig-zagged his way for the final 10 yards and into the tunnel. He was eventually greeted by the exuberant Rams coach, who ran down the sideline to celebrate his team going up by two touchdowns.
Stafford, who said he wanted to come to Los Angeles to play in big games, passed for 343 yards and four touchdowns as he outdueled Tom Brady and the Buccaneers (2-1), who had their 10-game regular season and playoff winning streak snapped.
Defensive tackle Aaron Donald was asked if he thought the Rams were one of the favorites to get to there: .
 said Donald, who had three tackles and got his first career sack against Brady.
 said Stafford, who completed 27 of 38 passes. 
Brady, who completed 41 of 55 passes for 432 yards and two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), joined Drew Brees as the only quarterbacks to throw for more than 80,000 yards.
Mike Evans finished with eight receptions for 106 yards for the Bucs (2-1).
Stafford went 8 of 8 for 74 yards on a 14-play, 95-yard drive capped off with Tyler Higbeeâ€™s 6-yard TD reception on a quick pass to give the Rams a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter.
Tampa Bay tied it on the ensuing drive when Chris Godwin took a jet sweep 2 yards around the right end, but the game wouldn't stay even for long.
The Rams took a 14-7 lead into halftime when Cooper Kupp caught a 2-yard TD with 54 seconds remaining. It was the first of two scores for Kupp, who had nine catches for 96 yards.
After Jackson's score, Brady got the Buccaneers within 21-14 on a 1-yard keeper, but the Rams put it out of reach with 10 straight points. Stafford threw his fourth TD, 10 yards to Kupp, and Matt Gay added a 48-yard field goal.
After the teams traded field goals, Tampa Bay added a touchdown with 1:10 remaining when Giovani Bernard scored on a reception from 7 yards.
Jackson, who finished with three catches for 120 yards, has nine career touchdown receptions of at least 75 yards, tying him with Hall of Famer Lance Alworth for the most in the NFL history according to Elias.
Tampa Bay's running game was virtually nonexistent again with 35 yards. Brady was the Bucs' leading rusher with 14 yards.
Sony Michel, acquired from New England during the preseason, made his first Los Angeles start and had 20 carries for 67 yards. Michel got the start with Darrell Henderson Jr. inactive because of a rib injury.
