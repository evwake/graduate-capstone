SEATTLE -- — Three straight losses overall for the first time in a decade. An 0-3 start at home for the first time in nearly 30 years.
But whether Wilson will be returning to play any relevant games for Seattle this season is the big unknown after the Seahawks’ 13-10 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Monday night.
This loss was almost entirely self-inflicted as Seattle (2-5) dropped its third straight. Alvin Kamara and Jameis Winston made some plays offensively, and Demario Davis was a terror on the defensive side for New Orleans.
But Seattle may look back on this loss with significant regret, playing their second full game without Wilson, who could return sometime in November.
The Seahawks have lost three straight for the first time since 2011, when they finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for one of two seasons in Carroll’s tenure. The last time Seattle started a season with three straight losses at home: 1992.
Wilson's replacement, Geno Smith, took several sacks in situations where he had to get the ball out of his hands. Jason Myers missed a pair of field goal attempts, one of which became decidedly longer because of a sack taken by Smith.
Marquise Blair was flagged for a personal foul on a third-down sack on New Orleans’ final drive when it appeared Seattle would get the ball back. Later in the drive, with a kicker in his first NFL game and lined up for a 43-yard field goal attempt, veteran Al Woods stunningly jumped offside, giving New Orleans a first down and eventually leading to an extra 90 seconds being burned from the clock.
It’s now three straight weeks that’s Smith had a opportunity in the final seconds to give Seattle the chance at a tie or victory. He threw an interception late against the Los Angeles Rams after Wilson was hurt. He fumbled in overtime last week to set up Pittsburgh’s game-winning field goal. And against the Saints, Smith took a pair of sacks that left Seattle in a desperation fourth-and-28 situation that came up empty.
