Commanders coach Ron Rivera was at a loss for words. It was a common feeling Sunday.
The Giants (7-4-1) ended a two-game losing streak, while the Commanders (7-5-1) are unbeaten in four (3-0-1) and have only one loss in their last eight games. The teams held the final two NFC postseason spots as the standings stood at the final whistle.
Neither had a realistic chance to score in the 10-minute overtime. Giants rookie linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux had a blindside sack on Taylor Heinicke at the Commanders' 1-yard line in OT, but all it did was help set up it a long-shot 58-yard field goal attempt by Graham Gano as time expired.
Gano had hit from 48 and 27 yards in the opposite direction. He estimated his maximum range in that direction was 53 yards. He was spot on. His kick was solid and dropped five yards shot.
Heinicke threw two touchdown passes for Washington and hit a crucial fourth-down pass on a tying 90-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.
 said Heinicke, who was 27 of 41 for 275 yards. 
Heinicke threw touchdown passes of 19 yards to Terry McLaurin (8 catches, 105 yards) and 28 to Jahan Dotson that tied it with 1:45 to play. That drive featured Heinicke rolling to his left to hit Curtis Samuel for 20 yards on a fourth-and-4 play from his own 27 with less than three minutes to play.
Daniel Jones threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Hodgins, and Saquon Barkley scored on a 13-yard run for the Giants, who are trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2016.
 said Jones, who finished 25 of 31 for 200 yards. 
The Giants' defense set up Hodgins' first NFL touchdown early in the second half for a 20-13 lead. Linebacker Azeez Ojulari, who came off injured reserve for the game, sacked Heinicke and forced a fumble. Oshane Ximines recovered, fumbled and Ojulari recovered at the 20-yard line.
Washington took leads of 10-0 and 13-10 only to see the Giants tie it just before halftime on Gano's second field goal. Joey Slye kicked two field goals for the Commanders.
McLaurin scored after breaking a tackle by Fabian Moreau on a short pass from Heinicke. He called the tie a weird expierience.
Barkley tallied on a 13-yard run through a gapping hole for New York's TD.
