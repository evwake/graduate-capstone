Ekeler rushed for 122 yards, scored two touchdowns and became the fifth running back with 100 receptions in a season as the Chargers cruised to a 31-10 victory Sunday over the Los Angeles Rams in a matchup of SoFi Stadium co-tenants.
 said Ekeler, who had the third 100-yard rushing game of his six-year career and second this season.
Ekeler, who has an NFL-leading 18 touchdowns (13 rushing, five receiving), also had a career-best 72-yard TD run midway through the second quarter to extend the Chargers' lead to 14-3.
The running game had 192 yards and averaged 6.2 yards per carry, the second-best performance of the season in both categories. That allowed the offense to be balanced as the Chargers had 31 run and 31 pass plays.
 said Justin Herbert, who completed 21 of 28 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. 
The balance even surprised the Rams. The Chargers began the day with the second-highest percentage of passing plays in the league.
Ekeler scored on consecutive possessions in the second quarter to give the Chargers a 14-3 lead. After having a 10-yard run off left guard to give the Bolts a 7-3 advantage, Ekeler patiently waited for a seam to develop on the right side of the line before going 72 yards.
It was the Rams' 11th loss of the season, surpassing the 1999 Denver Broncos for most defeats by a defending Super Bowl champion.
Los Angeles got to the Chargers' 35-yard line on their first possession of the third quarter, but Baker Mayfield turned it over after a strip-sack by Kyle Van Noy.
Cam Akers had his second straight 100-yard game with 19 carries for 123 yards. Baker Mayfield was 11 of 19 for 132 yards.
The lone touchdown for the Rams (5-11) was a 23-yard run up the middle by Malcolm Brown to get them within 14-10 in the second quarter.
Ekeler reached 100 receptions with his first catch, an 8-yard pass from Herbert on the Chargersâ€™ opening possession.
Mike Williams had seven receptions for 94 yards, including a one-handed, toe-tapping 18-yard grab along the left sideline late in the second quarter.
The Chargers found the end zone in the third quarter for the first time in 11 games when Herbert connected with Gerald Everett for an 8-yard touchdown to cap an 11-play, 75-yard drive to open the second half.
Herbert came into the game without a TD pass in two straight games for the first time in his three-year pro career.
Herbert's 3-yard TD pass to Donald Parham early in the fourth quarter gave Herbert a combined 100 rushing and passing touchdowns. That ties him with Dan Marino for the most through the first three seasons of a career.
