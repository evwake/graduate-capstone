DETROIT -- â€” There was no one close to Shane Zylstra when the Detroit Lions tight end caught his first NFL touchdown on Sunday.
Shane Zylstra, a 25-year-old in his second pro season out of Minnesota State, caught a 1-yard pass from Jared Goff with 20 seconds left in the first half, taking advantage of the chance to play after the team traded T.J. Hockenson to Minnesota this week. He was wide open on the play and gave the ball to offensive lineman Frank Ragnow to spike in celebration.
Brandon Zylstra had one kick return for 19 yards. The 29-year-old wide receiver is with his third NFL team and has also played in the Canadian Football League.
