INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- — Tua Tagovailoa might have shocked some observers by putting up one of the best passing days in an opener in NFL history.
 coach Mike McDaniel said after the Miami Dolphins rallied for a 36-34 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.
Tagovailoa threw for 466 yards, the fourth most in an opener, and three touchdowns. In a game that saw two ties and nine lead changes, his 4-yard throw to Tyreek Hill in the right corner of the end zone with 1:45 remaining put the Dolphins ahead to stay.
 said Tagovailoa, who completed 28 of 45 passes. 
Hill, who said during training camp he wants to be the first receiver to reach 2,000 yards in a season, got off to a great start. He had 215 yards — the third-best total in Week 1 in league history — on 11 receptions and two touchdowns.
 said Hill, who had his third 200-yard receiving game. 
Hill had two receptions on the decisive 8-play, 75-yard drive. On third-and-10 from the Dolphins 25, he beat Ja'Sir Taylor on a go route and caught a 47-yard pass after Tagovailoa stepped up in the pocket and made a pinpoint throw.
Different would be an understatement. In last season's 23-17 win in Week 13, the Chargers held the Dolphins to 219 total yards, with 119 coming on two plays, and didn't allow Miami to get into the red zone.
Tagovailoa's 466 passing yards were the most ever allowed by the Chargers, and Miami's 536 yards of offense is the most the franchise has yielded in an opener.
Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack blamed the defense for the loss, but also acknowledged the brilliance of Tagovailoa and Hill.
Miami had nine plays of at least 21 yards. Those included Hill's 35-yard score late in the third quarter to put the Dolphins up 27-24.
Raheem Mostert had 37 yards rushing, including a 2-yard TD in the first quarter. Jaylen Waddle had four receptions for 78 yards. Jason Sanders kicked three field goals.
After Hill's late TD, the Chargers turned it over on downs. Justin Herbert had an intentional grounding penalty and was sacked twice on the final series. He finished 23 for 33 for 228 yards with two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing).
Los Angeles rushed for 234 yards and three touchdowns, the fourth time since the team moved to Los Angeles in 2017 that it has exceeded 200 yards on the ground.
Austin Ekeler had 117 yards and a score, the fourth 100-yard game of his seven-year career. Joshua Kelley added 91 yards and had a 2-yard touchdown run a minute into the fourth quarter to make it 31-27.
Cameron Dicker kicked two field goals for the Chargers.
After Nick Williams recovered the Dolphins' botched snap at the LA 6, the Chargers went 14 plays, capped by Ekeler's 1-yard run off right tackle. It was the second time in the past three years, and fourth since 2000, that the Chargers have had a touchdown on their opening drive of the season.
The 94-yard series was tied for the second-longest TD drive to begin a season since 2000, and is the eighth of at least 90 yards.
It was Los Angeles' first fumble recovery on the opening defensive drive of the season in 11 years.
