FRANKFURT, Germany -- — Jonathan Taylor ran for a first-quarter touchdown and Mac Jones threw a crucial interception in the fourth quarter and the Indianapolis Colts held on for a 10-6 win over New England Patriots in Germany on Sunday.
The NFL’s 50th regular-season game outside the United States, and last of this season, was dominated by defense and Taylor’s first-quarter touchdown was the only one of the game. It was the lowest-scoring game in the league this season.
Colts coach Shane Steichen praised his team's  defense to limit the Patriots to two field goals.
Jones was sacked five times in the first half and was replaced with backup Bailey Zappe late in the fourth quarter.
Trailing 10-6 late in the fourth quarter, Jones drove the Patriots inside the red zone but was intercepted by Julian Blackmon on a pass intended for tight end Mike Gesicki at the 1-yard line.
Colts quarterback Gardner Minshew threw a 28-yard pass to Josh Downs for a first down that forced the Patriots to start using their timeouts. Minshew was 18 for 28 for 194 yards and Taylor had 69 yards on 23 carries. Michael Pittman had eight receptions for 84 yards. Dayo Odeyingbo had three of the sacks for the Colts.
After eventually forcing the Colts to punt, Zappe replaced Jones with 1:52 remaining in the game. After converting on a fourth down, Zappe attempted a fake spike, but threw into triple coverage and was picked off by Rodney Thomas to seal the game.
Jones was 15 for 20 for 170 yards and his league-leading 10th interception. Zappe, who replaced Jones for the third time this season, was 3 for 7 for 25 yards on the final drive. Rhamondre Stevenson had 20 carries for 88 yards and Ezekiel Elliott added 13 carries for 54 yards.
The Patriots have failed to score a touchdown in at least three games in their first 10 games of a season for the first time since 1995.
Chad Ryland's 37-yard field goal gave the Patriots an early lead, Taylor rushed for a 1-yard touchdown on fourth down after twice gaining first downs on third-and-1 earlier in the drive.
Matt Gay missed a 57-yard field-goal attempt for the Colts at the end of the second quarter to leave the score 7-3 at the half.
Ryland, who missed a 35-yard attempt early in the third quarter, had a 24-yarder early in the fourth quarter to reduce the Colts' lead to 7-6.
Gay then added 51-yard field goal restored the Colts' four-point lead on a drive that was aided by Isaiah McKenzie's 42-yard kickoff return.
The Colts won an international game for the first time, moving to 1-1, and the Patriots lost a regular-season game outside the U.S. for the first time after winning their previous three.
