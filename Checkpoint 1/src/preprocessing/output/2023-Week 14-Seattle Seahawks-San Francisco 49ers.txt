Brandon Aiyuk added 126 yards receiving as the quartet of playmakers for the 49ers (10-3) combined for 505 yards from scrimmage on the day to move San Francisco to the brink of winning back-to-back NFC West titles for the first time since 2011-12.
Drew Lock threw two TD passes in his first start since the end of the 2021 season in place of an injured Geno Smith, but couldn't keep up with the high-powered 49ers.
McCaffrey had a 72-yard run on the first play from scrimmage for San Francisco to set up a short TD run by Jordan Mason. Brock Purdy and Samuel took over from there after Purdy threw an early interception.
