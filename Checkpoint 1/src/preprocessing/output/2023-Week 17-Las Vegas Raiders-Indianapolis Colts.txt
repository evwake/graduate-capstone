Taylor ran for a season-high 96 yards and one score, Minshew fooled the Las Vegas defense with a 58-yard TD pass on third-and-1, and the Indianapolis Colts used two late defensive penalties to put away the Raiders 23-20 — and on the precipice of their first playoff berth since 2020.
Indy (9-7) enters next week's AFC South showdown against Houston with three straight home wins and tied atop the division with the Texans and Jacksonville.
A win, coupled with a Jaguars loss at Tennessee, would hand the Colts their first division crown since 2014.
Taylor had 21 carries and scored for the second straight week, looking more like the shifty, tough 2021 NFL rushing champ rather than the injury-limited runner of the past two seasons. Minshew finished 15 of 23 with 224 yards, no turnovers and two completions of 50 or more yards including the long scoring play to a wide-open Alec Pierce.
For the Raiders, their first loss in three weeks proved costly. They're now eliminated from the AFC's tight playoff chase after also fighting their way back into contention following a sluggish start.
Aidan O'Connell was 30 of 47 with 299 yards and two TDs, both to Davante Adams who had 13 receptions for 126 yards.
Still, it wasn't quite enough to pull the upset they did in 2021 when they won at Indy in Week 17 and wound up making the playoffs while the Colts were eliminated the following week with another loss.
Pierce wasn't around back then, but Taylor was and remembered it all too well. So on the sixth play of the game, Taylor delivered with a 5-yard TD run for a 7-0 lead.
Las Vegas answered with a 40-yard field goal and then Minshew connected Pierce, who broke free while running from the left side to the right to make it 14-3.
The Raiders closed to 14-10 after the Colts ran into punter A.J. Cole, extending a drive that eventually ended with O'Connell's 4-yard TD pass to Adams midway through the third quarter.
But Indy added three second-half field goals from Matt Gay, the final one set up by two penalties against Jack Jones — a pass interference call on third down and an offside call that negated Gay's kick that bounced off the right upright. Gay took advantage of his second chance to make it 23-13.
