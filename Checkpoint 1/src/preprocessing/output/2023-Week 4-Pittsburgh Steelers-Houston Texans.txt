HOUSTON -- — C.J. Stroud has thrown for the second-most yards by a rookie through his first four games in NFL history.
Stroud threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Houston Texans to a 30-6 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.
Stroud has thrown for 1,212 yards, which is second only to Cam Newton, who had 1,386 in his first four games for Carolina in 2011.
It’s the second straight win for the Texans (2-2) and their first at home since beating the Chargers on Dec. 26, 2021.
Houston’s 24-point win marked its largest margin of victory since a 57-14 win over Tennessee on Oct. 1, 2017.
Stroud, the second overall pick in the draft, continued his strong start and he threw a TD pass to get things going in a first half where the Texans built a 16-0 lead.
Sunday was his second 300-yard passing game, he has thrown six touchdown passes and set an NFL rookie record with 151 pass attempts without an interception.
He's the first rookie since the merger with 250 yards, two TD passes and no interceptions in three straight games.
Kenny Pickett threw for 114 yards with an interception and struggled to move the offense before leaving late in the third quarter with a knee injury.
The loss ends a two-game winning streak for the Steelers (2-2) and will likely increase the pressure on third-year offensive coordinator Matt Canada after another subpar offensive performance.
Mitch Trubisky threw for 18 yards after Pickett left.
Stroud handed the ball off to running back Devin Singletary, who tossed a 6-yard pass to Dalton Schultz to make it 23-6 with 11 minutes to go.
Stroud found Nico Collins on a 52-yard touchdown pass with about 3½ minutes left to push the lead to 30-6. Collins had seven receptions for a career-high 168 yards and two touchdowns.
T.J. Watt entered the game leading the NFL with six sacks, but he and the rest of the Steelers weren't able to get to Stroud and finished with zero sacks.
Chris Boswell got the Steelers on the board with a 35-yard field goal early in the third that made it 16-3.
Najee Harris made a 32-yard catch on third-and-4 to get the Steelers to the 8-yard line. But their drive stalled after that, and they settled for a 23-yard field goal to make it 16-6.
The Steelers went for it on fourth-and-1 from the Houston 33 and their next drive. But Pickett was sacked by Jonathan Greenard to give the Texans the ball back.
The Texans took an early 7-0 lead when Stroud threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Collins on their first drive.
Steven Nelson intercepted Pickett on Pittsburgh’s first possession to give Houston the ball right back. The Texans took advantage of the turnover when Kaʻimi Fairbairn made a 36-yard field goal late in the first quarter.
Houston pushed the lead to 13-0 when Fairbairn added a 38-yard field goal with about 12 minutes left in the second quarter.
A 39-yard field goal by Fairbairn as time expired in the second quarter left the Texans up 16-0 at halftime.
