INDIANAPOLIS --  Chuck Pagano wanted one more win as Indianapolis Colts coach. Now Pagano must wait to see if it will be his final victory with the team.
Jacoby Brissett threw for one touchdown and Marlon Mack ran for another as the Colts beat Houston 22-13 in the season finale for both teams.
The win ended the longest losing streak of Pagano's six seasons. It did nothing to quell speculation whether he'll be back next season, which has been the hottest topic in town since the Colts (4-12) were eliminated from the playoffs for the third consecutive season.
All the Texans could muster were two long first-half field goals and a 2-yard TD run from Alfred Blue in the second quarter to help them build a 13-7 halftime lead. The offense even gave away points early in the fourth period when Hassan Ridgeway sacked T.J. Yates in the end zone for a safety.
Brissett threw a 6-yard TD pass to Jack Doyle on the first play of the second quarter for Indy's first score, and the Colts took the lead for good when Mack scored on a 2-yard plunge midway through the third quarter.
Adam Vinatieri made field goals from 54 and 22 yards in the fourth quarter.
Frank Gore needed 139 yards rushing for his second straight 1,000 yard season. The Colts gave him a steady diet of carries, and when he limped off the field early in the fourth quarter after a short run, the fans gave him a rousing ovation. He returned later and finished with 24 carries for 100 yards.
Colts: Indy played without right tackle Denzelle Good (knee) and defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins (ankle). It lost safety Kenny Moore in the first half (concussion) and he did not return.
