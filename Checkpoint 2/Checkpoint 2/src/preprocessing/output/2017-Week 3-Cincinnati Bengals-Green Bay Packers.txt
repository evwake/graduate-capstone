Coach Zac Taylor said he wanted to see Mixon at full speed on Thursday before he can make a judgment about his fitness for Cincinnati's (3-1) game against the Green Bay Packers (3-1) on Sunday.
Mixon was hurt during last Thursday's come-from-behind win over Jacksonville. If he canâ€™t play, the Bengals will go with backups Samaje Perine and rookie Chris Evans, who have been spot players so far.
The Bengals' injury news was mostly positive, though, with safety Jessie Bates fully participating in practice. Cornerback Chidobe Awuzie (groin), receiver Tee Higgins (shoulder) and defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi (knee) had limited participation. All could possibly play Sunday.
