On the next possession, Mariota found a wide-open Jonnu Smith for a 24-yard TD and a 23-14 lead.
Murray's TD gave Tennessee a 30-14 lead late in the quarter, and Tennessee finished with 195 yards rushing.
Wilson pulled Seattle within 33-27 with his fourth TD, an 8-yarder to Paul Richardson with 1:50 left. But Titans tight end Delanie Walker recovered Seattle's onside kick.
The Seahawks had one last chance with the Titans lined up to punt on fourth-and-3 with 11 seconds left. Then officials flagged the Seahawks for 12 men in the formation, giving Tennessee the clinching first down.
Then Wilson locked arms with center Justin Britt, followed by his teammates as the Seahawks walked onto the field.

The Seahawks finished with 11 penalties for 98 yards, with a trio of penalties on separate plays in the first quarter. The second came when three-time All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman was flagged three times on a play erasing a Kam Chancellor interception. Sherman was flagged for pass interference and holding on Titans veteran wide receiver Eric Decker, and unsportsmanlike conduct. Sherman later was flagged for unnecessary roughness for hitting Mariota on the sideline, setting off a scrum that wound up with offsetting penalties.
Titans rookie Adoree Jackson had an 80-yard punt return late in the second quarter erased by an illegal block in the back.
Murray's TD was the longest allowed by the Seattle defense since Frank Gore had an 80-yarder against the Seahawks in 2009. That was before coach Pete Carroll was hired in January 2010.
Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin, who caught 10 passes for 105 yards and a TD, left in the fourth quarter with an injured groin. ... Seattle lost linebacker Dewey McDonald to a knee injury on the opening kickoff. He did not return.
