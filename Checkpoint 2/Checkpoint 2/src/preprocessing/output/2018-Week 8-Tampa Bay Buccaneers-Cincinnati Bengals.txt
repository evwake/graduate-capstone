CINCINNATI -- Jessie Bates returned Jameis Winston's fourth interception for a touchdown Sunday, and Randy Bullock kicked a 44-yard field goal on the final play that sent the Cincinnati Bengals to a 37-34 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who now have a question at quarterback.
Winston was benched after matching his career high with four interceptions. Ryan Fitzpatrick rallied the Buccaneers (3-4) to a 34-34 tie with a pair of touchdown passes, including his 18-yard toss with 1:05 left.
The Bengals (5-3) recovered from their second-worst drubbing under Marvin Lewis and pulled it out with their only scoring drive in the second half. Andy Dalton had completions of 23 and 9 yards to A.J. Green that got them in field goal range.
He threw four interceptions for the third time in his career, including one directly to Bates that the safety returned for Cincinnati's fourth defensive touchdown of the season. Winston went to the bench, and Ryan Fitzpatrick pulled Tampa Bay even.
Fitzpatrick threw a 72-yard touchdown to Mike Evans, his fifth TD pass of at least 50 yards this season -- most in the NFL. He also led an 88-yard drive to the tying score, hitting O.J. Howard for an 18-yard touchdown and completing another pass for the conversion.
Winston opened the season on a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy and has thrown for six touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Against the Bengals' depleted defense, Winston went 18 of 35 for 276 yards with four interceptions and five sacks.
Fitzpatrick finished 11 of 15 for 194 yards and a passer rating of 154.9.
DeSean Jackson caught a 60-yard touchdown pass that moved him ahead of Jerry Rice for the NFL record. He has 24 TDs of at least 60 yards. It also was Jackson's 29th career TD of at least 50 yards , tying Randy Moss for second-most since the 1970 merger behind Rice's 36.
Cincinnati couldn't hold a 27-6 lead set up by a big first half. Joe Mixon ran for 114 yards in the half and scored on runs of 1 and 8 yards. Tyler Boyd had six catches for 112 yards, including a 9-yard touchdown.
The Bengals were coming off a 45-10 loss at Kansas City on Sunday night.
Winston has thrown at least two interceptions in five straight games, tied for the most since 1990. His 13 interceptions over that span are tied with Fitzpatrick for the most in a five-game stretch over the past five seasons.
Bengals: Have their bye week, followed by a home game against the Saints.
