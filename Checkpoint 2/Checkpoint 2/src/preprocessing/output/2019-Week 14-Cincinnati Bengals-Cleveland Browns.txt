The Browns can't even win without some kind of theatrics,. And, once again, Odell Beckham is in the middle of the latest drama.
Nick Chubb ran for 106 yards -- 99 after halftime -- and Baker Mayfield and Kareem Hunt had rushing touchdowns as Cleveland kept its faint hopes alive Sunday with a 27-19 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, who outplayed the Browns but couldn't get their second win.
Denzel Ward returned an interception 61 yards for Cleveland's first score, and the Browns (6-7) got a huge late break when Mayfield's third interception was reversed with a rare interference call to bounce back after a discouraging loss at Pittsburgh last week.
Following the game, Beckham had little to say about either subject.
Beckham spoke softly in front of his locker before leaving FirstEnergy Stadium with his head covered by a hooded blue jacket. Earlier this week, the three-time Pro Bowler was vague about his future in Cleveland, fueling speculation he wants to be dealt for the second time in less than a year. He had just two catches for 39 yards.
 said wide receiver Jarvis Landry, who had four catches for 76 yards, including a late 34-yarder that helped put away the Bengals. 
The Bengals (1-12) couldn't build on their win last week over the Jets and have dropped 19 of 21 over the past two seasons.
Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon rushed for a career-high 146 yards and scored a TD. Bengals kicker Randy Bullock had field goals of 34, 44, 28 and 46 yards, the last with 12 seconds to go.
The Bengals outgained the Browns 451-333 and topped them in every statistical category but the final score.
Mayfield appeared to throw his third pick with 4:58 left when cornerback William Jackson III tipped a pass intended for Beckham and it was grabbed by Jessie Bates III and returned inside the 20. But Browns coach Freddie Kitchens challenged that Beckham was interfered and won the review.
For some reason, Kitchens decided not to run the ball in the first half despite having the NFL's leading rusher (Chubb) and facing the league's worst run defense. Cincinnati came in allowing 157.6 yards per game. Cleveland had just 30 yards rushing at halftime with Chubb getting only 7 on three carries.
That changed immediately in the third quarter. Cleveland came out with a 75-yard drive -- all on the ground.
Cincinnati had numerous chances to get its second win, but came up short.
 said Dalton, who went 22 of 38 for 262 yards. 
Ward's TD was the first by Cleveland's defense in 39 games. Dalton's pass went off Auden Tate's hands and to Ward, who streaked down the sideline for unit's first TD since Oct. 15, 2017. ... Cleveland rookie K Austin Seibert booted a season-high 53-yard field goal. ... Mayfield joins Bernie Kosar (1986-1987) and Brian Sipe (1979-1981) as the only Browns QBs with consecutive 3,000-yard seasons. ... Cleveland's four-game home winning streak is the team's longest since 2007.
