GREEN BAY, Wis. --  Slowing down led to a huge day for Aaron Jones.
After a 20-15 win over the Washington Redskins on Sunday, Jones credited Green Bay Packers running backs coach Ben Sirmans with teaching him to take his time and let plays develop. Jones said thanks to Sirmans' help, he was able to run wherever he wanted against Washington.
Jones rushed for a season-high 134 yards and a touchdown on just 16 carries, Aaron Rodgers threw for 195 yards and a score and the Packers did enough to put away the Redskins.
Jones had his third 100-yard rushing game of the season and hauled in six passes for 58 yards.
Adrian Peterson became the sixth back in NFL history to reach the 14,000-yard mark, running for 76 yards and a score for Washington (3-10), which was eliminated from playoff contention.
Peterson has 14,036 yards in a 13-year career. Curtis Martin is fifth all-time with 14,101 yards.
Dwayne Haskins completed 16 of 27 passes for 170 yards and a touchdown with an interception. The rookie was sacked four times, including one where he hurt his ankle.
Kenny Clark and Kyler Fackrell combined for a sack of Haskins on Washington's opening drive for an 11-yard loss. Haskins and the Redskins started the day with three straight three-and-outs in the franchise's first-ever December trip to Lambeau Field.
Jones scored from 4 yards on the Packers' opening drive. It was Jones' 12th rushing touchdown and 15th TD of the season. Rodgers, who was 18 of 28 passing, found Robert Tonyan for a 12-yard touchdown on Green Bay's other first-quarter score.
Haskins led Washington on an 11-play, 95-yard drive that was capped by a 2-yard run by Peterson with 3:44 to play in the first quarter. Dustin Hopkins missed the extra point.
After Mason Crosby's field goal, Hopkins nailed a 52-yarder to cut it to 17-9 before the end of the third.
With the Packers still holding an eight-point lead with 8:28 to play, Rodgers found Jones for a 25-yard gain on third-and-14. That first down helped set up a 33-yard attempt by Crosby. The 13-year veteran was good on the kick with 2:34 to go to seal the win.
Haskins linked up with Terry McLaurin on a 13-yard score late. Haskins was stopped by Blake Martinez on the 2-point conversion.
About 30 to 40 protesters were outside of Lambeau Field speaking out against the  name. One sign read,  while another read, 
Redskins: Guice hurt his knee while being tackled by Darnell Savage after a 23-yard run in the second quarter. He did not return. Linebacker Ryan Kerrigan left in the second half with a calf injury. Cornerbacks Fabian Moreau and Quinton Dunbar each left in the first half with hamstring injuries. Moreau returned.
