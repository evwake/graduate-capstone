EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --  If this was Eli Manning's final start at home in a career that saw the New York Giants win two Super Bowls, it was one that sent chills down the spine.
The two-time Super Bowl MVP threw two touchdowns and New York snapped a franchise record-tying nine-game losing streak with a 36-20 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.
Saquon Barkley ran for 112 yards and scored two walk-in touchdowns and New York's much-maligned defense added a safety as the Giants (3-11) handed the Dolphins (3-11) their second loss in as many weeks at MetLife Stadium.
Manning threw a 51-yard scoring pass to Golden Tate in the second quarter and a go-ahead 5-yarder to Darius Slayton on the opening series of the second half. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 draft also threw three interceptions, two of which set up field goals by Dolphins kicker Jason Sanders.
Tate said Manning refused to take the spotlight after the game, turning the focus away from himself to the importance of winning.
 said Manning, who finished 20 of 28 for 283 yards.
Ryan Fitzpatrick, whose game slipped after taking a big hit on a third-quarter scramble, threw two touchdowns to DaVante Parker, the second one with the game out of reach.
Buck Allen added a late 1-yard TD run in the Giants' biggest offensive output of the season.
Manning stole the show in the second half, leading the Giants to three touchdowns on their first five possessions. His pass to Slayton wiped out a 10-7 deficit and Barkley, who had not run for 100 yards in the previous seven games, added TD runs of 1 and 10 yards.
Fitzpatrick, who was 6 of 16 in the second half for 78 yards, said the Dolphins could get nothing going.
The Dolphins took a 10-7 halftime lead on a 20-yard touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick to Parker and a 24-yard field goal by Sanders.
Manning and Tate combined on a 51-yard catch and run to tie the game 7-all just 62 seconds after the Parker catch.
