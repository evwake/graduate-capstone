 fellow tackle Morgan Moses said. 
Stanley was an All-Pro in 2019, but his 2020 season was cut short by an ankle injury, and he only played in one game last year. It's still not clear what his status will be for Sunday's opener on the road against the New York Jets. Stanley was at practice Monday, but coach John Harbaugh wasn't saying anything definitive about his outlook.
Although the Ravens aren't completely healthy, the Jets are also dealing with some significant uncertainty as quarterback Zach Wilson works his way back from a preseason knee injury. Wilson threw on the field Monday, but if he can't go, then Joe Flacco is in line to play against his former team.
Although not everyone who was hurt last season is back yet, the Ravens have mostly avoided any major new injuries this year during camp. Of course, they haven't made it to the first game quite yet. Last year, Edwards and Peters went down at practice in the days leading up to the season opener.
