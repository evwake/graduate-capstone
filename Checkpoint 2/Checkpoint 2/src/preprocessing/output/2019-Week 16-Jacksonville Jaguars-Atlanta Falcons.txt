Devonta Freeman scored two touchdowns before Jacksonville took a snap, and that was enough to send the Falcons past the woeful Jaguars 24-12 Sunday in a match-up between teams long since eliminated from the NFL playoff race.
Matt Ryan threw for 384 yards and Julio Jones had his biggest game of the year, hauling in 10 catches for 166 yards.
Before thousands of empty seats at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Falcons (6-9) won their third straight game while holding the Jaguars (5-10) to 288 yards in the home finale.
Atlanta piled up 518 yards.
The only solace for Quinn is another strong finish. In 2018, the Falcons closed with three straight wins. Now, they've got another three-game run that is largely meaningless in the grand scheme of the season.
The Falcons took the opening kickoff and drove 82 yards in six plays, capped by Freeman's 17-yard touchdown run. He took a quick flip from Ryan and scampered to the end zone without being touched.
On the ensuing kickoff, Michael Walker was stripped of the ball by Keith Smith. Brian Hill fell on the fumble at the Jaguars 25, sending Atlanta's offense back on the field with barely enough time to catch its breath.
Four plays later, Ryan hooked up with Freeman out of the backfield on an 8-yard scoring pass.
Even with Ryan being picked off twice, Jacksonville couldn't muster much of an offensive threat behind Minshew, who was 13 of 31 for 181 yards.
Quadree Ollison tacked on a 3-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to stretch Atlanta's lead to 24-6.
The Jaguars finally reached the end zone on Minshew's 42-yard TD to Chris Conley with 12 minutes remaining. But their last hurrah ended on Minshew's incomplete pass in the end zone on fourth-and-goal from the Atlanta 7.
Jones became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 12,000 career yards.
It also was his 55th 100-yard receiving game, leaving him just two behind Marvin Harrison on the career list in that category.
Meanwhile, Ryan reached 4,000 yards passing for the ninth straight season.
Drew Brees is the only player with a longer streak, passing for 4,000 yards in 12 straight seasons from 2006-17.
Beasley had just 1.5 sacks through the first eight games, but he now has 6.5 in the last seven.
He had one of three Atlanta sacks against Minshew, with Pro Bowl selection Grady Jarrett also getting one.
Hill downed one of Allen's punts at the Jaguars 1, and another at the 2.
Jaguars: Close the season at home against the AFC South rival Colts (7-8), looking to avenge a 33-13 loss at Indianapolis in the teams' first meeting.
Falcons: Travel to Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers (7-8), who romped to a 35-22 victory when the NFC South teams met in Week 12.
