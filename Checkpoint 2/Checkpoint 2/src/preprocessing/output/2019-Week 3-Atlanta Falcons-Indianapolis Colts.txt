He was poised, accurate and turnover free. He helped the Colts score points, avoided mistakes and capitalized when opportunities arose.
Brissett completed his first 16 passes, threw for two touchdowns in the first half, led the Colts to scores on their first four drives and even converted a late third down with an 11-yard completion to Jack Doyle to close out a 27-24 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.
But in his first game at Lucas Oil Stadium since Luck announced his surprise retirement last month, Brissett stepped onto the big stage and delivered a masterpiece. When the Falcons tried to load up on Indy's emerging ground game, Brissett spread it around, completing 28 of 37 with 310 yards, his second-highest single-game total and third 300-yard game of his career, even as Pro Bowl receiver T.Y. Hilton missed the second half because of a quad injury.
Brissett took one sack and kept Indy's final scoring drive alive by scrambling 6 yards on third-and-5.
The Colts scored on five of their seven possessions, punted once and picked up three first downs on the final drive to prevent Matt Ryan and the Falcons (1-2) from getting a chance to win it or force overtime after cutting the deficit to 27-24 with 4:11 left.
After Ryan threw two TD passes to Austin Hooper to make it a 20-17 game early in the fourth quarter, Brissett answered quickly.
He ran for one first down, picked up another with a defensive holding call, hooked up with Zach Pascal for 35 yards on third-and-1 and then watched Marlon Mack score on a 4-yard run to make it 27-17 with 8:40 to play.
Ryan's 10-yard TD pass to Julio Jones made it a three-point game but Atlanta never got the ball back.
After missing five of his first eight kicks, 46-year-old Adam Vinatieri reverted to his traditional form. He made all five Sunday, starting with a 49-yard field goal that he banked in off the left upright.
Colts: Hilton aggravated the quad injury that slowed him in practice this week and defensive tackle Tyquan Lewis (ankle) did not play in the second half. Cornerback Kenny Moore II (forearm), defensive tackle Denico Autry (eye) and defensive end Al-Quadin Muhammad (stringer) all returned.

Jones had eight catches for 128 yards and Devonta Freeman had 16 carries for 88 yards. ... Atlanta committed 16 penalties for 128 yards, one penalty short of matching the franchise record.
