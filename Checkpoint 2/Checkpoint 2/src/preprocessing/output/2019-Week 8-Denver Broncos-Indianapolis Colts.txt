INDIANAPOLIS --  Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich was so confident in Adam Vinatieri, he opted to play for a long field goal Sunday.
Even after the NFL's career scoring leader opened the game by missing a 45-yard field goal wide right. Even after the league's best clutch kicker missed the tying extra point in the third quarter.
Eventually, Vinatieri rewarded Reich's faith. In his 200th career game with the Colts, Vinatieri made a 51-yard field goal with 22 seconds left to give Indy a 15-13 come-from-behind victory over the Denver Broncos.
This season has made some wonder about Vinatieri's reliability. He missed five of eight kicks in the first two weeks before seemingly settling with only one miss -- a long field goal -- in Indy's next four games.
Then came the two misses Sunday and suddenly everyone outside the Colts' organization held their collective breath when Reich called two runs from just inside the Broncos 35 in the final 73 seconds. But Vinatieri delivered by again living up to his reputation.
The final kick gave Indy (5-2) a third straight win and kept it atop the AFC South.
When Denver took over at the Colts 48 midway through the fourth quarter, the Broncos called two short passes and one run before punting. When the Broncos took over at their own 38 with 3:37 left, they called four runs and one short pass before another punt.
Flacco did what he could, but Denver settled for two short, first-half field goals -- one capping a 17-play drive that consumed nearly eight minutes, the other to finish a 13-play drive that took another 5 1/2 minutes.
Vinatieri made it 6-3 at the half with a 55-yard field goal.
After the Broncos opened the second half with a 4-yard TD run from Royce Freeman , Vinatieri made a 45-yard field goal and Marlon Mack's 10-yard TD run made it 13-12. That's the way it stayed -- until Vinatieri took advantage of his final shot.
