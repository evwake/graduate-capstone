CINCINNATI --  Joe Burrow ran 23 yards for a touchdown in his NFL debut and put the Bengals in range for a dramatic, last-minute win. Instead, he ended up like so many Cincinnati quarterbacks before him, wondering what the heck just happened.
The Heisman Trophy winner and national champion from LSU threw an interception on a shovel pass  to thwart one late scoring chance, and he watched as Randy Bullock missed a 31-yard field goal -- Bullock's calf cramped -- with 2 seconds left Sunday, clinching the Chargers' win.
A line anchored by Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram III pestered him and held him to 23 of 36 passing for 192 yards with three sacks and a costly interception. Burrow overthrew open receivers John Ross and A.J. Green for what would have been touchdowns.
Still, he had a chance for the dramatic win.
He moved the Bengals to the LA 23-yard line in the closing minutes and made a rookie mistake, forcing a shovel pass that Ingram picked off.
Taylor finished 16 of 30 for 208 yards. Joshua Kelley ran 5 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.
The Bengals took a low-risk approach with Burrow, using a lot of short passes. Burrow was under consistent pressure from the Chargers' line.
His first NFL score came on a designed draw play that surprised the Chargers. The middle of LA's defense opened, and Burrow  ran 23 yards untouched, slamming the ball to the ground in celebration.
The two late drives  that ended with an interception and missed field goal provided a spark of what could be.
The Chargers open SoFi Stadium against Kansas City, which beat Houston 34-20 on Thursday night in the season opener.
The Bengals play at Cleveland on Thursday night. Cincinnati beat Cleveland 33-23 at Paul Brown Stadium to end last season, one of the Bengals' two wins.
