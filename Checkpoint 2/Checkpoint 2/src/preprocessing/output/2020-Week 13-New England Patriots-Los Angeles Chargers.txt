Newton ran for two touchdowns and the Patriots scored two TDs on special teams in Sunday's 45-0 rout of the Los Angeles Chargers. The Patriots (6-6) have won two straight to get back into playoff contention in the AFC going into the final quarter of the season.
It was the fifth time in franchise history that the Patriots have won a game by 45 or more points. And it was the worst loss in Chargers history, eclipsing a 49-6 defeat to Kansas City in 1964.
Newton has four games this season with multiple rushing touchdowns, breaking the league record for a quarterback. He had three such games in 2011, an achievement he shared with five others, and has 10 in his career, three more than any other QB.
The Patriots set the tone on the opening drive, going 75 yards — 57 on the ground — in 13 plays. Newton finished it off with a 1-yard dive.
Newton added a 2-yard keeper up the middle in the second quarter. He has 11 rushing scores on the year, making him the first QB with three seasons of at least 10 rushing TDs. He had 14 as a rookie with the Carolina Panthers in 2011 and 11 in 2015 when he was named MVP.
Gunner Olszewski took Ty Long’s punt 70 yards up the right sideline early in the second quarter, putting New England ahead 14-0. The Patriots' second special teams score came on the last play of the first half, when Devin McCourty returned a blocked field-goal attempt 44 yards to the end zone. New England led 28-0 at halftime.
It is the seventh time in league history a team has returned a punt and blocked field goal for TDs in the same game. The last team to do that was Baltimore in 2015. New England is the only team to have accomplished it in the regular season and the playoffs.
Newton completed 12 of 19 passes for 69 yards, including a 5-yard pass to N’Keal Henry during the third quarter that extended New England’s lead to 35-0.
Jarrett Stidham replaced Newton early in the fourth quarter and threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Olszewski.
Rookie Justin Herbert was 26 of 53 for 209 yards for the Chargers. He was intercepted twice.
Olszewski joined Stanley Morgan, Irving Fryer and Julian Edelman as the only players in Patriots history to have a special teams and receiving score in the same game. Olszewski had an 82-yard punt return TD nullified by a penalty last week against Arizona.
This was Belichick's 455th game as a head coach, moving him past Tom Landry for third in NFL history. Belichick is also third in wins with 309.
Belichick — who coached Cleveland from 1991-95 and has led New England since 2000 — is behind Don Shula in wins and games coached. Shula leads both lists (526 games, 347 wins) followed by George Halas (506 games, 324 wins).
