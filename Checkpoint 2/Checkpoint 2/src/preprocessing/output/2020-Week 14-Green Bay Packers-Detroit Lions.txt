DETROIT -- â€” The Detroit Lions were hoping Matthew Stafford had one more fourth-quarter comeback this season.
Unfortunately for the Lions, he was in the locker room when the team had a chance to salvage Sunday's 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers
Stafford sustained a rib injury while diving for a first down at the Packers 5 with 7:07 to play. He stayed in the game long enough to hand off to Kerryon Johnson for a touchdown on the next play, cutting Green Bay's lead to 28-21, but was with the Lions medical staff when he reached the sideline.
Stafford ended up in the X-ray room, which meant after Mason Crosby's 57-yard field goal made it 31-21 with 3:35 to play, it was Daniel trying to pull off the comeback.
Jamal Agnew's 71-yard kickoff return gave the veteran a short field, but a scramble into the end zone was called back by a holding penalty. Matt Prater's field goal made it 31-24, but the ensuing onside kick went out of bounds and Green Bay ran out the clock.
Stafford played well when he was on the field, completing 24 of 34 passes for 244 yards and a touchdown, but Detroit's defense couldn't stop Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers went 26 for 33 for 290 yards and three touchdowns to improve to 17-5 against the Lions. He also scored on a 6-yard run.
The game was tied at 14 at the half, but Green Bay dominated the third quarter. The Packers started the quarter with a 14-play, 90-yard scoring drive capped off by Rodgers' rushing touchdown. After a three-and-out for the Lions, Rodgers led a 12-play, 79-yard drive that ended on a 4-yard touchdown pass to Robert Tonyan early in the fourth quarter.
The Lions might have still had a chance had a challenged call gone their way with 9:08 to play. Marvin Jones twisted to make a leaping catch at the goal line, but it was ruled he had come down out of bounds. After a long review, the officials shocked Jones by upholding the ruling.
