The rookie ran for a franchise-record 253 yards, scored twice and sprinted 45 yards to the end zone with 3:35 to play, powering the Colts to a playoff-clinching 28-14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
Tomlinson's best was a 243-yard performance against the Raiders in 2003 â€” one year before Rivers arrived in San Diego and three years before Rivers made his first start.
That meant the Colts (11-5) were in the seven-team playoff field with a win. The No. 7 seed heads to Buffalo on Saturday, its first postseason appearance since 2018 and its second since 2015, thanks largely to Taylor.
He got started with a 56-yard burst on Indy's third play, which set up one score. His 1-yard TD run in the second quarter made it 17-0.
Jacksonville (1-15) finally responded with a touchdown in the final minute of the first half and another in the third quarter to close within 20-14 and it looked like Indy might squander another big lead.
Afterward, Colts players and coaches gathered to watch on TV as Tennessee's last-second field goal thwarted their AFC South championship hopes.
Hall of Famer Edgerrin James was the only other Colts player to top 200 yards. He had a 219-yard game at Seattle in October 2000 then ran for 204 yards four years later at Chicago.
Taylor tied DeMarco Murray for the ninth-highest single-game rushing total in NFL history.
More changes could be coming Monday. Coach Doug Marrone is 12-36 since leading Jacksonville to the AFC championship game following the 2017 season and seems resigned to the possibility of losing his job. He said he spoke to team owner Shad Khan before the game about reports that Urban Meyer could replace him.
