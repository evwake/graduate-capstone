CINCINNATI -- â€” The Minnesota Vikings overcame a choppy start to storm back and tie the game after regulation against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Dalvin Cook's fumble was recovered by Cincinnati linebacker Germaine Pratt to set up the game-winning score, a 33-yard field goal by Evan McPherson as time expired on Sunday.
It was a rough end after Minnesota had battled back from a 21-7 second-half deficit despite a raft of penalties. The Vikings committed 12 for 116 yards. They had three false starts in their opening drive, with four penalties in the first eight plays.
Cornerback Bashaud Breeland had a rough day, too. He committed a pass-interference penalty that led to a Bengals touchdown and was beaten by receivers, including rookie Ja'Marr Chase who beat him for a 50-yard touchdown just before halftime.
Cook, who was the NFL's second-leading rusher last season, fumbled with 2 minutes left in overtime. The Vikings challenged the fumble call, but were overruled.
Then Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, checking to a pass play on fourth-and-inches, hooked up with C.J. Uzomah for a 32-yard gain to get well within the range of the rookie McPherson, who won it as time ran out.
Cousins, who was 36 for 49 for 351 yards and two touchdowns, said it was a tough opener to lose because it was so tight at the end.
Minnesota will try to rebound against Arizona on Sunday.
