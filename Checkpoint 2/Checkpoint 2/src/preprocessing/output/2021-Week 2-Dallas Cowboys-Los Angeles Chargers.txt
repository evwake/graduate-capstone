INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- â€” Throughout his rehab from a broken ankle last season, Dak Prescott thought about what it would feel like to be on the field again and lead the Dallas Cowboys on a game-winning drive.
Prescott directed the Cowboys on an 11-play, 49-yard march against the Los Angeles Chargers, culminating in Greg Zuerlein's 56-yard field goal as time expired for a 20-17 victory on Sunday.
 said Prescott, who completed 23 of 27 passes for 237 yards and an interception. 
Dallas (1-1) overcame the loss of five players who started its opener and ruined the Chargers' first game in front of home fans at SoFi Stadium.
Prescott got Dallas into Chargers territory with a 12-yard completion to Amari Cooper to the LA 45 with 36 seconds remaining. Three plays later, Zuerlein booted it through for his 11th game-winning kick and third with the Cowboys.
The Cowboys had a little more balance offensively after dropping back to pass 59 times in 77 plays last week. Tony Pollard had 109 yards on 13 carries for the third 100-yard game of his career and Ezekiel Elliott had 16 carries for 73 yards.
The Chargers (1-1) got their 10th 300-yard game from Justin Herbert, but turnovers and penalties ended up looming large. Los Angeles was flagged 12 times for 99 yards and had a pair of touchdowns taken away.
Herbert's 37-yard TD pass to a wide-open Donald Parham was nullified when Jared Cook was called for holding. Three plays later, Herbert was intercepted in the end zone by Damontae Kazee on third-and-6 from the Dallas 9 after Keenan Allen appeared to slip on his route.
In the fourth quarter, a motion penalty took away a 2-yard score for Cook. The Chargers had to settle for Vizcaino's third field goal to even it at 17.
 said Herbert, who was 31 of 41 for 338 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. 
Dallas jumped out to a 14-3 lead early in the second quarter on touchdowns by Pollard and Elliott.
The Chargers closed to within a field goal on Mike Williams' 12-yard TD on a wide receiver screen after he had a 27-yard reception to get them into the red zone. Los Angeles then made the 2-point conversion on Austin Ekeler's run up the middle.
Vizcaino tied it at 14 with a 32-yard field goal midway through the third quarter.
Vizcaino had a chance to tie it late in the first half, but his 44-yard attempt hit the left upright with 3 seconds remaining. Dallas got the ball at its 49-yard line, and Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb, who found an opening and went up the right sideline. He lateraled at the 17 to Elliott, who was forced out of bounds by Derwin James at the 3.
