But they were doomed by their inability to run the ball or prevent big plays in a 24-9 loss to the Carolina Panthers.
Carolina’s top-ranked defense sacked Mills four times and held him to 168 yards passing. Mills was pressed into action after Tyrod Taylor suffered a hamstring injury last Sunday and was placed on injured reserve.
Mills threw for a touchdown and avoided big mistakes after he threw an interception in the second half of Sunday’s loss at Cleveland. But the Texans (1-2) finished with just 42 yards on the ground, and that forced Mills into tough down-and-distance situations as Houston punted six times.
Mark Ingram ran six times for 21 yards and David Johnson had two carries for 11 yards.
Mills’ favorite target was Brandin Cooks, who had nine receptions for 112 yards.
Sam Darnold threw for 304 yards and ran for two touchdowns to lead the Panthers to the convincing win despite losing star running back Christian McCaffrey early in the second quarter.
Anthony Miller grabbed a 1-yard touchdown pass about 30 seconds before halftime, but Joey Slye missed the extra point. Miller made his debut with the Texans after he missed the first two games with a shoulder injury.
The Panthers took over the game after halftime, outscoring Houston 17-3 to cruise to the win.
Darnold had a 32-yard run and threw a 30-yard pass to Tommy Tremble on a drive that ended with a 21-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. And he found Terrace Marshall for a 23-yard gain to power a drive that ended with Darnold’s 1-yard scoring run that put the game away with about four minutes to go.
