SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- â€” Russell Wilson spun away from a sack and delivered a perfect strike for another TD pass.
Wilson overcame a rough opening to the game by throwing for two touchdowns  and running for a third and the Seahawks rebounded from back-to-back losses by beating the San Francisco 49ers 28-21 on Sunday.
Wilson connected on a 12-yard TD pass to DK Metcalf late in the first half and then produced two touchdowns in a span of less than a minute in the third quarter with a 16-yard run  and 13-yard pass to Freddie Swain around a fumbled kickoff by Trenton Cannon.
The TD pass to Swain was vintage Wilson, who spun away from a blitzing Dontae Johnson and avoided Nick Bosa before finding Swain for the TD that Wilson ranked as one of the top 10 plays of his career.

Alex Collins added a 14-yard TD run early in the fourth quarter and the 49ers (2-2) were unable to overcome it after losing starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to a calf injury at halftime and playing without injured kicker Robbie Gould all game.
Garoppolo threw a 21-yard TD pass to Ross Dwelley on the opening drive but did little else before leaving with the injury.
Rookie Trey Lance took over and connected on a 76-yard touchdown pass to Deebo Samuel  but the Niners only crossed midfield one other time before scoring on another TD pass to Samuel with 1:20 remaining. Seattle recovered the onside kick to seal the game.
Lance finished 9 for 18 for 157 yards with two TDs, 41 yards rushing and a 2-point conversion run.
The Seahawks took plenty of time to get going offensively with five straight three-and-outs to begin the game. Seattle was held to minus-7 yards on those possessions  before finally breaking through with a 28-yard pass to Collins on the opening play of the sixth drive.
Wilson then completed a 28-yard pass to Metcalf to get Seattle into the red zone and capped the drive with a 12-yard throw to Metcalf  that tied the game at 7.
