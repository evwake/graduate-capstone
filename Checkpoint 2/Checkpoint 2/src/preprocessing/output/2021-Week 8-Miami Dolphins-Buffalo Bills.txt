Call it what you want, all that mattered was Allen finally finding his groove in time to pull out a 26-11 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.
In doing so, the Bills (5-2) rebounded from a heartbreaking 34-31 loss to Tennessee on Oct. 18 by continuing their dominance over an AFC East rival. The Bills beat the Dolphins for a series-record seventh consecutive time, outscoring them by a combined 258-123 in this run.
After going 10 of 19 for 80 yards through Buffalo’s first series of the second half, Allen closed 19 of 23 for 169 in blowing open a game that had been tied at 3.
The Bills went ahead 10-3 in the third quarter when Allen shrugged off Jaelan Phillips’ bid for a sack and found a wide-open Gabriel Davis for an 8-yard touchdown  reception. He followed up capping a nine-play, 69-yard drive by hitting  Stefon Diggs on a post route for a 19-yard TD.
The Dolphins cut the lead to 17-11 on Tua Tagovailoa’s 1-yard plunge and 2-point conversion pass to Mike Gesicki early in the fourth quarter.
Allen responded by marching the Bills on a 14-play drive, which ended with Tyler Bass hitting a 39-yard field goal. Jordan Poyer sealed the victory by intercepting a pass Tagovailoa sailed over the middle while facing third-and-26 from his 19 with 2:21 remaining.
The Bills quarterback then waved good-bye to the Dolphins after scoring on a 7-yard touchdown run with 1:07 left.
After losing three times on walk-off field goals this season, including their past two games, the Dolphins’ squandered a pair of scoring attempts in the first half.
Jason Sanders hit a 51-yard field goal with the wind behind him in the second quarter but missed a 36-yard attempt wide left into the wind in the first quarter.
Tagovailoa finished 21 of 39 for 205 yards and an interception amid speculation on the Dolphins interest in acquiring Deshaun Watson from Houston before the NFL’s trade deadline on Tuesday. Tagovailoa’s career record dropped to 7-7.
 Dolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins said. 
Bass opened the scoring with a 57-yard attempt, which ranks as the fourth longest in team history, and third longest at what is now called Highmark Stadium.
