Jackson threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter — one of which came thanks to a fortuitous carom — and the Ravens beat Cincinnati 34-20 on Thursday night after the Bengals lost Joe Burrow to a wrist injury.
Burrow left in the second quarter after throwing a touchdown pass and wasn't able to return. Baltimore tight end Mark Andrews is expected to miss the rest of the season after hurting an ankle.
The injuries overshadowed this huge divisional matchup, but only to a degree. It was a huge win for a Baltimore team that has been dominant at times but hasn't been able to pull away in the tough AFC North.
The Bengals were up 10-7 after Burrow's 4-yard scoring toss to Joe Mixon, but the Ravens answered when Jackson's pass over the middle bounced off linebacker Germaine Pratt and right to receiver Nelson Agholor, who caught the ball in stride and punctuated the 37-yard touchdown with a flip into the end zone.
Jackson threw a 10-yard TD pass to Rashod Bateman with 23 seconds left in the half to put Baltimore up 21-10.
Jake Browning, a 27-year-old backup who had played in only one NFL game, relieved Burrow and was able to guide the Bengals to a field goal to start the second half. But that was all he could manage until he threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Ja'Marr Chase with 1:08 remaining in the game.
Browning was 8 of 14 for 68 yards.
Jackson threw for 264 yards despite losing Andrews on the first drive of the game.
Gus Edwards bookended Baltimore's day offensively with 3-yard touchdown runs — the first made it 7-0 and the latter 34-13.
The Ravens had five sacks, increasing their league-leading total to 44.
The lights went out during Baltimore's victory over San Francisco in the Super Bowl in New Orleans after the 2012 season.
