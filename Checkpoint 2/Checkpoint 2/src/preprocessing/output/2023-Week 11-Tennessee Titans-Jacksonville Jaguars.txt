Lawrence also ran for two scores for the first time in three NFL seasons, becoming the first player in franchise history with two TD passes and two rushing scores in the same game.
Lawrence completed 24 of 32 passes for 262 yards, finishing with the fourth-best passer rating (119.5) of his career after the third-lowest outing against the 49ers.
