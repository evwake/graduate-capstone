Flowers had a touchdown catch and ran for a game-sealing score late in the fourth quarter as the AFC-best Ravens beat the Los Angeles Chargers 20-10 on Sunday night.
Baltimore forced four turnovers while the offense was balanced with 197 yards rushing and 177 passing.
Jackson completed 18 of 32 passes and ran for 39 on 11 carries, becoming the fourth quarterback in NFL history to exceed 5,000 rushing yards.
The Chargers largely bottled up Jackson and the Ravens' offense in the second half, but Flowers put the game away when he took an end-around on third-and-2 and dashed for a 37-yard touchdown with 1:36 left.
Flowers' first touchdown came with 10:46 remaining in the second quarter when he caught a 3-yard pass in the back of the end zone on a crossing route to give the Ravens a 7-3 lead.
The Chargers came into the game tied for league low with eight giveaways. Their four turnovers were the most since they had that many in a Week 3 loss to Carolina in 2020.
Justin Herbert was 29 of 44 for 217 yards with a touchdown and an interception for the Chargers (4-7), who have lost three straight and are last in the AFC West. Keenan Allen had 14 receptions for 106 yards.
Gerald Everettâ€™s 3-yard touchdown reception with 8:32 remaining in the fourth quarter pulled Los Angeles within 13-10. The tight end caught the ball at the 1 and then outmuscled Ravens safety Marcus Williams.
The Chargers had a chance to possibly send it into overtime after Justin Tucker missed a 44-yard field goal attempt with 2:57 remaining. They took over at their own 34 and drove to the Ravens 46. But they turned it over on downs when Herbert was pressured in the pocket and was called for intentional grounding on fourth down.
Jackson joined Michael Vick, Cam Newton and Russell Wilson as the only quarterbacks in the 5,000-yard rushing club on an 8-yard keeper in the third quarter.

The possession featured a trick play when Allen caught a 3-yard pass from Herbert and then lateraled to Austin Ekeler, who took it 14 yards to the Ravens 39.
The Chargers got the ball first and took a 3-0 lead on Cameron Dicker's 39-yard field goal.
Los Angeles drove to the Baltimore 6-yard line on Herbert's 5-yard scramble, but guard Jamaree Salyer was called for unnecessary roughness after he took exception to what appeared to be an out of bounds hit on Herbert by Ravens safety Geno Stone.
