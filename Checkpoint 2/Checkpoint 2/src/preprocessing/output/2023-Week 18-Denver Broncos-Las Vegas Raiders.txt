An even bigger statement was made on the field Sunday as Las Vegas continued its dominance over the Denver Broncos with a 27-14 victory behind Aidan O'Connell passing for 244 yards and two touchdowns, Zamir White rushing for 112 yards and a relentless pass rush.
This was the Raiders' eighth consecutive victory over their AFC West rivals and 10th in 11 games. That includes a 4-0 record in Las Vegas.
As for the game itself, Las Vegas took full control on the first play of the fourth quarter. O'Connell overcame a injury to the index finger on his throwing hand — he didn't play the Raiders' first drive of the second half — to complete a 33-yard touchdown pass to Jakobi Meyers to put Las Vegas ahead 24-7.
Meyers also scored a TD in the second quarter, turning what was designed to be a wide receiver pass to a 5-yard run when the play broke down.
Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham made his second start in a row in favor of the benched Russell Wilson. Stidham passed for 272 yards with a TD and interception and was sacked five times and hit 11 times. He quarterbacked the Raiders over their final two games last season in place of Derek Carr, who also was benched.
The Raiders also weren’t penalized Nov. 26 against the Kansas City Chiefs.
