INDIANAPOLIS -- Denver quarterback Brock Osweiler ran for one touchdown and threw for two more Thursday night to lead the Broncos past Indianapolis 25-13.
The Broncos (5-10) needed it. After ending an eight-game losing streak Sunday, they picked up their first road win since Dec. 4, 2016.
He was 12 of 17 with 194 yards and took the Broncos on three second-half scoring drives -- giving the league's top-rated defense more than enough points.
C.J. Anderson ran 30 times for a season high 158 yards.
After Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett scored on a 7-yard run and Adam Vinatieri made it 10-0 with a 45-yard field goal midway through the second quarter, all Indy could muster was a 39-yard field goal early in the third.
He capped a 75-yard drive with an 18-yard TD run to make it 10-7 at halftime, then gave Denver the lead with a 22-yard TD pass to Cody Latimer 4:16 left in the third quarter. Osweiler added a 54-yard TD pass to Jeff Heuerman and a 2-point conversion pass to Latimer to make 22-13 and Brandon McManus sealed the victory with a 40-yard field goal.
Broncos: Osweiler's TD pass to Heuerman ended an 18-game regular-season streak without a 50-yard completion and a 13-game regular season streak without a TD pass of 40 more yards. ... Emanuel Sanders had seven catches for 68 yards and Demaryius Thomas had five catches for 69 yards.
Colts: Brissett was 17 of 30 with 158 yards. ... Indy had 228 yards in offense. ... T.Y. Hilton caught five passes for 41 yards. ... Indy fell to 2-5 at home and will have its first losing season at home in Pagano's tenure.
When he returned for the start of the second half, he quickly became the second player in league history to post 1,000 yards from scrimmage in 12 consecutive seasons. Only Emmitt Smith (13) has more.
Gore finished with 10 carries for 31 yards and remains fifth on the NFL's career rushing list.
Colts: In addition to Williams, the Colts lost right tackle Denzelle Good (knee) and linebackers Jeremiah George (neck) and Jon Bostic (knee) in the second half.
