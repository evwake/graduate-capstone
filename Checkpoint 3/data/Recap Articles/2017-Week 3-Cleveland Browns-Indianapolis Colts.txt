INDIANAPOLIS -- Jacoby Brissett ran for two touchdowns, threw for another and the Colts defense held off Cleveland's late charge Sunday to preserve a 31-28 victory.
Brissett, acquired in a trade with New England earlier this month, looked much more comfortable in his second start, going 17 of 24 with 259 yards and running five times for 14 yards.
Brissett was the primary reason for the Browns latest loss.
He started the scoring with a 5-yard TD run, broke a 7-7 tie by spinning away from pressure and scooting 7 yards for his second score and then hooked up with T.Y. Hilton on a 61-yard TD pass to make it 21-7 -- all in the first half.
Frank Gore's 4-yard scoring run made it 28-7.
Cleveland spent the rest of the game playing catch-up, but had two second-half scoring chances snuffed out by Rashaan Melvin's interceptions.
Hilton caught seven passes for 153 yards. He scored on a nifty catch-and-run by cutting from the sideline across the field to take advantage of the over-pursuing safety Jabrill Peppers. And Hilton set up a second score by drawing a pass interference penalty at the Browns 11-yard line.
The Browns got a 19-yard TD run from Duke Johnson Jr. and two touchdown passes from DeShone Kizer -- a 1-yarder to David Njoku just before halftime and an 11-yarder to Kenny Britt. Kizer scored on a 1-yard plunge with 2:04 left to cut the deficit to 31-28.
Kizer finished 22 of 47 with 242 yards and threw three interceptions. He also ran seven times for 44 yards.
Gore ran 25 times for 57 yards and became the ninth player in NFL history to record 3,000 carries. He has 3,011, and the milestone came on his 4-yard TD run.
