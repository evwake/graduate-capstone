Mayfield threw a season-high three touchdown passes and rookie Nick Chubb streaked 92 yards for a TD as the Cleveland Browns ended a four-game losing streak with their best all-around performance in years, a stunning 28-16 win over the Falcons on Sunday.
Mayfield completed his first 13 passes and finished 17 of 20 for 216 yards. He threw a 28-yard scoring pass to Rashard Higgins, a 13-yarder to Chubb and 11-yarder to Duke Johnson. He went 12 of 12 for 165 yards and two TD passes in the first half, and didn't throw his first incompletion until 11:14 remained in the third quarter.
Ryan threw two touchdown passes but the Falcons (4-5) had their three-game winning streak -- and any playoff momentum -- stopped cold.
With the Browns backed up at their 8, Chubb, who had 176 yards on 20 carries, took a handoff and headed right. He cut toward Atlanta's sideline, picked up a block and then showed his surprising breakaway speed while finishing the longest run in team history.
Chubb's run broke the previous team mark held by Bobby Mitchell, who had a 90-yard TD run against Washington on Nov. 15, 1959. It was also the second-longest run by a rookie in league history, behind only Bobby Gage's 97-yard run for Pittsburgh in 1949.
One of the few positives for the Falcons was receiver Julio Jones, who had 107 yards and became the fastest player to reach 10,000 with a 30-yard catch in the second quarter. Jones reached the 10,000-yard plateau in his 104th game, 11 quicker than Calvin Johnson.
 Ryan said of Jones, who is tied with Hall of Famer Randy Moss with 45 career games with 100 yards or more receiving, the most for a player in his first eight seasons. 
 Mayfield said, drawing laughter. 
While Mayfield was sublime in the first half, the Browns did have one interception.
Running back Dontrell Hilliard took a pitch and threw an ill-advised pass back toward Mayfield, who was well covered and the ball was picked by Falcons safety Damonte Kazee, who leads the league with five interceptions.
