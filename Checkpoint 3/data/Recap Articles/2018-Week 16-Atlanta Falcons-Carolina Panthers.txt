Ryan had 239 yards passing and threw touchdown passes to three different wide receivers, the Falcons ran for 194 yards without Devonta Freeman and Atlanta beat Carolina 24-10 on Sunday. It was the seventh straight loss for the Panthers (6-9), who were eliminated from playoff contention.
Ryan found Calvin Ridley for a go-ahead, 75-yard touchdown strike on the first play of the second half when Panthers safety Eric Reid bit on a play-action fake. He also connected with a wide-open Mohamed Sanu on a crossing route for a 44-yard score and threw a 1-yard TD pass to Julio Jones in the back of the end zone.
Ridley had three catches for 90 yards tied the franchise rookie record for TD catches in a season with eight. Sanu had five grabs for 81 yards, and Brian Hill had 115 yards rushing on eight carries.
The Falcons intercepted first-time starter Taylor Heinicke three times and forced four turnovers after allowing a touchdown on the game's opening possession. Heinicke, making his first NFL start for the injured Cam Newton, left the game briefly in the second quarter with a left elbow injury, but returned and was repeatedly battered by the Falcons.
He finished 33 of 53 for 274 yards with one touchdown.
Carolina's Christian McCaffrey had 21 carries for 101 yards and 12 receptions for 77 yards to set an NFL record for receptions in a season (106) by a running back.
He became the third running back in league history to record 100 receptions and 1,000 yards rushing in a season, joining LaDainian Tomlinson and Matt Forte. McCaffrey has 1,080 rushing yards and 845 receiving yards, giving him an outside chance to become only the third player to post 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving.
Reid knelt again before Sunday's game.
Jones continued to be a problem for the Panthers. He came into the game averaging more than 100 yards in 12 career games against Carolina and didn't wait long to assert himself with four catches for 28 yards and 1-yard TD catch on Atlanta's first possession.
