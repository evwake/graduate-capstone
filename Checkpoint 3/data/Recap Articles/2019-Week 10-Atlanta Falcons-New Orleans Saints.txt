Sacking Brees six times and holding New Orleans without a touchdown, the Falcons ended their six-game slide with a 26-9 victory over the Saints on Sunday that ended New Orleans' six-game winning streak.
 said Jarrett, who had a team-leading 2  1/2 sacks. 
It was a stunning improvement for a Falcons' defense that came in with an NFL low-seven sacks. It happened against a Saints offensive line that had allowed 12 sacks through their first eight games.
Matt Ryan, returning from an ankle injury that sidelined him in the game before the Falcons' Week 9 bye, was 20 of 35 for 182 yards and two touchdowns.
Ryan's first touchdown went for 8 yards to tight end Austin Hooper in the second quarter and his second to running back Brian Hill in the fourth quarter to put Atlanta (2-7) in front 20-9.
Defensive end Vic Beasley Jr. had 1  1/2 sacks. Fellow end Adrian Clayborn and linebacker De'Vondre Campbell each had one.
The Saints had not been held without a touchdown at home with Brees running the offense since the record-setting QB joined New Orleans in 2006. But it was the second time this season the Saints had not found the end zone at home -- the first a 12-10 victory over Dallas with backup Teddy Bridgewater filling in for a then-injured Brees.
Quinn was struck by how good the coverage was, giving pass-rushers more time to get to Brees.
Julio Jones caught three passes for 79 yards -- including a 54-yarder to set up a field goal -- for Atlanta, which possessed the ball nearly 34 minutes and rolled up 317 yards. The Falcons were the first Saints opponent since Seattle in Week 3 to gain more than 257 yards.
Brees went 32 of 45 for 287 yards and the Saints finished with 310 yards, well below their average of 375.3 coming in. That's despite getting running back Alvin Kamara and tight end Jared Cook back from injuries. Other than receiver Michael Thomas, who caught 13 passes for 152 yards, few Saints offensive regulars approached their usual production.
The Saints committed 12 penalties for 90 yards. Half of those infractions produced Falcons first downs and four extended drives on third or fourth down.
With 9:01 left, J.T. Gray, who had blocked a punt in Chicago in Week 7, committed a 15-yard, roughing the kicker penalty trying to block another. That led to Younghoe Koo's 48-yard field goal, which widened Atlanta's lead to 23-9.
