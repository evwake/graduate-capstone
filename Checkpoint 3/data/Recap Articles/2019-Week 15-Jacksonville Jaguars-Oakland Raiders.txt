Minshew threw two TD passes to Chris Conley in the final 5:15 of the game and the Jaguars spoiled the final scheduled game at the Coliseum by beating the Raiders 20-16 on Sunday.
The Jaguars (5-9) drove 79 yards to draw within 16-13 on Minshew's 6-yard TD pass to Conley.
The Raiders tried to run out the clock and got a pair of first-down runs from Josh Jacobs and another from Derek Carr. But Carr was ruled out of bounds with 2:05 to play after trying to slide down inbound, sparing the Jaguars from using a timeout.
Oakland then got a delay of game in the confusion and Tyrell Williams dropped a third-down pass. Daniel Carlson then missed a 50-yard field goal only to get another chance after Parry Nickerson was called for running into the kicker.
Carlson missed again from 45 yards and the Jaguars took over at the 35 with 1:44 to go. Minshew moved them down the field and connected with Conley on the 4-yard score with 31 seconds left.
The Raiders moved the ball to the Jacksonville 40, but Carr's two desperation throws in the closing seconds fell incomplete and the Jaguars held on for the win.
Security guards surrounded the field beginning late in the third quarter in hopes of preventing fans from rushing on the field and the biggest issue during the game came early in the fourth quarter when referee Bradley Rogers politely asked fans not to shine lasers on the field.
A few fans rushed the field well after the game and some lit off fireworks in the parking lots well after the stands had emptied.
The Raiders broke out to a 16-3 lead thanks to a 40-yard TD pass from Carr to Tyrell Williams on the first drive and three field goals by Carlson. But Oakland didn't score again and lost.
