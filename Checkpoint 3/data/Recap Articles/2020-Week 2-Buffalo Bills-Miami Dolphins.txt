The third-year pro threw for 417 yards  and four touchdowns, both personal bests, and the Buffalo Bills beat AFC East rival Miami for the fourth consecutive time Sunday, 31-28.
Allen reached a career high in yards passing for the second week in a row, and became the first Buffalo quarterback to have consecutive 300-yard games since Drew Bledsoe in 2002.
Trailing 20-17, the Bills (2-0) reclaimed the lead for good with 6 minutes left on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Allen to rookie Gabriel Davis, who made a diving catch  in the end zone.
Allen's 46-yard touchdown pass to John Brown  sealed the win.
The only other Bills player to throw for at least 415 yards and four scores was Joe Ferguson in 1983.
Allen led an offense that totaled 524 yards, including 342 in the first half, the Bills' most since 2000.
The Dolphins have become Allen's favorite foil: He has thrown for 12 touchdowns, rushed for three and thrown one interception in his past four games against Miami. Of his 36 career TD passes, 14 have come against the Dolphins.
He finished with touchdown passes to four receivers, and Stefon Diggs led the Bills with eight catches for 153 yards.
The Dolphins had a first down at the Buffalo 1 late in the third quarter but failed to score, with Preston Williams dropping a fourth-down pass that could have given them the lead.
The Dolphins closed to 31-28 on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Mike Gesicki and a successful 2-point conversion with 49 seconds left. The Bills' Micah Hyde recovered the ensuing onside kick.
Fitzpatrick went 31 for 47 for 328 yards and two TDs. Mike Gesicki had eight catches for 130 yards and a touchdown, but the Bills' defense did just enough.
The Bills took a 7-0 lead on a 97-yard drive that culminated with a 1-yard pass to Reggie Gilliam. It was the first NFL touchdown reception for Gilliam, an undrafted free agent out of Toledo.
Groups of spectators were required to space at least 6 feet apart in both the lower bowl and upper deck. The crowd was less than 20% of the stadium's capacity.
