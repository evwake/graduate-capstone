Goff threw three touchdown passes to Tyler Higbee and the Los Angeles Rams beat the Philadelphia Eagles 37-19 on Sunday.
Goff completed his first 13 passes, including a pair of TDs to Higbee, and the Rams jumped to a 21-3 lead minutes into the second quarter.
After the Eagles (0-2) pulled within one score, Goff's 28-yard TD pass to Higbee in the fourth iced it for Los Angeles (2-0).
McVay got his first win over Doug Pederson and the Eagles in three tries. McVay outcoached defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz early as Los Angeles scored TDs on its first three possessions.
Goff finished 20 of 27 for 242 yards. Wentz was 26 of 43 for 242 yards and two interceptions.
Darrell Henderson ran for 81 yards and had his first career TD run. The Rams gained 449 total yards, including 191 on the ground. Higbee had three TD catches all of last season on 69 receptions.
The Rams took a 7-0 lead on Goff's 4-yard TD pass to Higbee after Miles Sanders' fumble on the third play gave them the ball at the Eagles 41.
Robert Woods ran in from the 5 on a perfectly executed end-around following a fake hand-off up the middle to make it 14-3.
Goff's 3-yard TD toss to Higbee increased the lead to 21-3.
But the Eagles answered with a 1-yard sneak by Wentz and 5-yard TD run by Sanders to get within 21-16 at halftime.
The Eagles were driving on their first possession of the third quarter but Darious Williams made a diving interception in the end zone on Wentz's pass to J.J. Arcega-Whiteside.
The Rams turned that into a 30-yard field goal by Samuel Sloman for a 24-16 lead. Jake Elliott's 33-yarder cut it to 24-19.
After Wentz was sacked eight times at Washington last week, Aaron Donald and the Rams were held to no sacks. It didn't matter on the scoreboard.
Second-round pick Jalen Hurts, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy last season, made his debut for the Eagles and lined up in a two-back set in the backfield as Wentz completed a 10-yard pass to Dallas Goedert to the Rams 8 on Philadelphia's first drive. Hurts also lined up as a receiver a few times.
