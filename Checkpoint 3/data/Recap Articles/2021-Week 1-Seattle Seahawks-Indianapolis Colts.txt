He found open receivers, converted third downs and took advantage of a solid ground game by making big play after big play. Then he turned things over to the defense.
Wilson threw three of his four touchdown passes in the first half Sunday and Seattle's defense clamped down in the second half as the Seahawks pulled away for a 28-16 season-opening victory at Indianapolis.
Despite taking no preseason snaps, Wilson led the Seahawks to touchdowns on their first two drives and posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in the first half. He wound up with the second-highest single-game rating of his 10-year career, 152.3, and fell one TD pass short of matching his career high. He finished 18 of 23 with 254 yards with the biggest blow coming on a 69-yard TD pass to Tyler Lockett in the final minute of the first half to give Seattle a 21-10 lead.
Seattle took a 7-3 lead when Lockett made a twisting, over-the-shoulder catch for a 23-yard score late in the first quarter. Wilson then hooked up with a wide-open Gerald Everett for a 9-yard score that made it 14-3.
After Carson Wentz cut the deficit to 14-10 with a 10-yard scoring pass to Zach Pascal in his Colts debut, Wilson found Lockett free behind two Colts safeties to make it 21-10 at the half. He sealed it with a 15-yard TD pass to Pro Bowl receiver DK Metcalf with 6:41 left in the game.
And while the Colts defense played better in the second half, the offense bogged down with Wentz under heavy pressure.
Twice, Indy failed to convert fourth-down attempts in Seattle territory and didn't score again until Wentz connected with Pascal on an 11-yard TD pass with 2:08 to go. Wentz was 25 of 38 with 251 yards but it wasn't enough.
