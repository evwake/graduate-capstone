Tom Brady threw for 232 yards and a touchdown and Brown made a grand return to the NFL on Sunday as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers routed the Carolina Panthers 32-6 to win their first NFC South title since 2007.
The Bucs (11-4) put up 391 yards on offense after being shut out 9-0 by the New Orleans Saints last week.
Brown saw a prominent role on offense with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin sidelined by injuries, catching 10 passes for 101 yards while being targeted 15 times by Brady in his first game since Oct. 13.
He repeatedly made big catches in a featured role against 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore to move the chains early in the game.
Brown's return was huge for the Bucs, who proved they can win even with many of their top weapons out.
Ronald Jones replaced the injured Leonard Fournette and carried 20 times for 65 yards and a touchdown.
Tampa Bay also got big offensive contributions from unheralded players like Ke’Shawn Vaughn, who ran for a 55-yard touchdown, and Cyril Grayson, a COVID-19 replacement player elevated to the active roster this week who hauled in a 62-yard reception to set up Brady’s only TD pass, a 4-yarder to Cameron Brate.
The Bucs' defense had no problems shutting down Carolina's dual-quarterback approach, even after Pro Bowl linebacker Shaquil Barrett left with a knee injury in the second quarter.
Tampa Bay had seven sacks and limited the Panthers (5-10) to two field goals.
Newton was 7 of 13 for 61 yards and ran for 42 yards en route to losing his 13th straight game as a Carolina starter, a streak that dates back to the 2018 season. Darnold, who was greeted by boos as he entered the game for the first time, finished 15 of 33 for 190 yards.
