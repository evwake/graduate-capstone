BENGALS PLAYER TO WATCH: RB Joe Mixon. With star wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase expected to miss a few games with a hip injury, the Bengals may have to be more reliant on their running game. Mixon has yet to have a 100-yard game this season, but he's had some big ones in the past against Cleveland, including a 162-yard performance in 2019.
BROWNS PLAYER TO WATCH: WR Amari Cooper. He's become QB Jacoby Brissett's comfort blanket, the go-to target when a big play is needed. Last week, they hooked up on a 55-yard reception, the Browns' longest play this season. This will be Cooper's first foray in the Cincinnati-Cleveland rivalry.
KEY MATCHUP: Bengals WRs Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd vs. Cleveland's defensive backs. Chase's absence puts more pressure on Cincinnati's other wideouts to produce. The Browns could be without Denzel Ward, who has missed the past two games with a concussion.

FANTASY TIP: Chubb has averaged 94.6 yards in seven career games against the Bengals with five rushing TDs, one receiving. After a sluggish start last weekend, Chubb picked it up after halftime as coach Kevin Stefanski called his number more often. If the Browns aren't down by double digits, that could be the formula again.
