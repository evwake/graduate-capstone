They capitalized on turnovers, made big plays at timely moments and, yes, even managed to protect a late lead.
Carson Wentz threw two long TD passes, Jonathan Taylor ran for two more scores and a stifling defense closed out a critical 31-3 victory over Houston.
This time, the Colts seized control quickly in the second half — and the defense held up against the struggling Texans, who have lost five straight.
Indy's offense delivered a decisive second-half scoring flurry — and the defense never backed down.
Two-time All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard picked off rookie quarterback Davis Mills on Houston's first play of the third quarter. Wentz capitalized two plays later with a 28-yard TD pass to Mo Alie-Cox for a 17-3 lead.
Taylor started Indy's next series with an 83-yard run and capped it with a 4-yard TD rush to make it 24-3.
The Texans spent the rest of the game futilely playing catch-up and getting nowhere as Taylor sealed the victory with an 11-yard TD run with 4:47 left.
All Houston could muster was Ka'imi Fairbairn's 31-yard field goal late in the first half.
Texans: Safety Terrence Brooks left in the first half with a bruised long, did not return and was scheduled to spend the night in Indianapolis. Culley already has ruled him out of next week's game. Receiver Danny Amendola (thigh), starting center Justin Britt (knee) and left tackle Laremy Tunsil (left thumb) all missed Sunday's game. Receiver Chris Conley left briefly after hurting his neck but returned later.
Colts: Receiver Parris Campbell hurt his left foot after catching a 51-yard TD pass in the first half and did not return. Four-time Pro Bowl receiver T.Y. Hilton (quad) and cornerback Rock Ya-Sin (ankle) left in the fourth quarter and stayed out. Indy again played without right tackle Braden Smith (foot, thumb) and three-time All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson (ankle).

Giovanni Hamilton, the teenage boy who developed a special relationship with Wentz when he was in Philadelphia, attended Sunday's game. They first met at training camp in 2019 and Hamilton later unveiled Wentz's new No. 2 jersey following the March trade that sent Wentz from the Eagles to the Colts.
