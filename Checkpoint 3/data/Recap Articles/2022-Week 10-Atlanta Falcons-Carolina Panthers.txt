The No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft has only attempted 12 passes through two exhibition games with very limited success, completing seven for 56 yards with no touchdowns. Young has led five drives with three of them resulting in three-and-outs. The Panthers have scored just three points with the 2021 Heisman Trophy winner under center.
Reich said he's relying on Young's extensive workload in practice to help him prepare for the team's Sept. 10 regular-season opener against the Atlanta Falcons, which Young will start.
Reich’s former team, the Indianapolis Colts, didn’t even play Anthony Richardson in this past weekend’s preseason game against the Chicago Bears just four days after selecting him as the Week 1 starter.
Reich reiterated that Young will play in the final preseason game Friday night against the Detroit Lions, although he wouldn't say how much.
It’s been somewhat difficult to evaluate Young’s performance through two games because of Carolina’s struggles to protect him. The rookie was hit three times on seven drop-back passes in the team's first preseason game against the New York Jets.
Reich said overall he's pleased with how the rookie QB has progressed and the poise he displayed in the pocket against the Giants while leading a 15-play, 62-yard drive that resulted in a field goal.
The Panthers waived defensive tackle Marquan McCall, who had been listed as the team's starting defensive tackle in the unofficial depth chart. McCall was an undrafted rookie in 2022 who played 16 games last season for the Panthers. Reich said it came down to McCall not being the right fit for the team's 3-4 defensive scheme.
