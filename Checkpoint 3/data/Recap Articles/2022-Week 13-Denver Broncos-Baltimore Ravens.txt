Huntley led Baltimore 91 yards in 16 plays on its final possession, capping it with a 2-yard touchdown run with 28 seconds remaining that gave the Ravens a 10-9 win over the Denver Broncos on Sunday. Huntley took over when Lamar Jackson left the game with a knee injury after the first quarter.
With or without Jackson, the Ravens (8-4) were mostly shut down offensively. Neither team managed 300 total yards, but when it needed to, Baltimore drove almost the whole length of the field. The Ravens were aided by two big penalties — for unnecessary roughness and pass interference — on the Broncos.
Once in the red zone, Huntley converted on fourth-and-2 from the Denver 18 with a short run. Then he slipped a pass to Kenyan Drake along the sideline for 13 yards and scored his touchdown on the next play.
Russell Wilson led the Broncos (3-9) back into Baltimore territory, but Brandon McManus came up short on a 63-yard field goal as time expired.
Denver's offense couldn't shake out of its season-long funk, and three field goals by McManus weren't enough. The Broncos have lost four straight, scoring only 45 points in that span.
Baltimore's four losses were all by four points or fewer, and the Ravens were coming off a 28-27 defeat in which Jacksonville scored the winning touchdown and 2-point conversion with 14 seconds to play. This was a happier finish for Baltimore.
Jackson left after being sacked by Jonathon Cooper on the last play of the first quarter. The 2019 NFL MVP didn't seem as though he was in too much distress when he exited the sideline tent and walked to the tunnel, but he didn't come back in the game.
Huntley went 27 of 32 for 187 yards with an interception. Wilson was 17 of 22 for 189 yards.
McManus made a 52-yard kick on the game's first possession, but Huntley led Baltimore to a field goal on his first full drive. McManus connected from 41 near the end of the half and 50 in the third quarter.
The Ravens finally had another promising drive going in the fourth, but that ended when they ran a reverse pass on second down at the Denver 29. James Proche II threw deep into heavy coverage, and the pass was intercepted in routine fashion by Justin Simmons.
The Ravens failed to force a turnover for the first time in 14 games. They also had fewer than three sacks for the first time in eight.
