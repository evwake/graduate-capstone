CHICAGO -- — Aaron Rodgers figured the Green Bay Packers were in a good spot and would find a way to pull out the win. Given his history against the Chicago Bears, it wasn't exactly a big leap of faith.
Rodgers led three fourth-quarter scoring drives, receiver Christian Watson took an end-around 46 yards for a touchdown in the closing minutes after Jaire Alexander intercepted Justin Fields, and Green Bay rallied to beat Chicago 28-19 on Sunday.
The Packers (5-8) looked like they were on their way to another loss after dropping seven of eight. They trailed by 13 in the second quarter and were down 19-10 through three before before outscoring Chicago 18-0 in the fourth on the way to their eighth straight win over their rival. The Bears (3-10) lost their sixth game in a row.
AJ Dillon ran for a 21-yard touchdown in the opening minute of the fourth. Mason Crosby kicked a 32-yard field goal to give Green Bay a 20-19 lead with just under five minutes left after Chicago's Cairo Santos had a 40-yard attempt blocked.
The Bears drove to the Packers 43 before Alexander stepped in front of a pass intended for Equanimeous St. Brown. Three plays later, Watson sprinted untouched to the end zone, leaping across the goal line with his arms spread. The Packers opted to go for 2, and Rodgers completed a pass to Mercedes Lewis, making it 28-19 with 1:51 remaining.
The Bears were left frustrated and vowing to do better after failing to convert late in a game yet again. Chicago has six losses by one score, and this was almost the seventh.
Rodgers, who exited last week’s loss to Philadelphia with a rib injury and has been dealing with a broken right thumb since early October, improved to 25-5 against Chicago including the playoffs. The four-time MVP completed 18 of 31 passes for 182 yards and a touchdown.
Watson had 48 yards receiving and a touchdown reception — the rookie's seventh in the past four games — to go with that huge run. Dillon ran for 93 yards, and the Packers moved ahead of Chicago for the NFL lead in regular-season wins with 787.
Fields, who missed last Sunday's game with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder, ran for a 55-yard touchdown in the first quarter and finished with 71 yards on six attempts. That gave him six straight games rushing for at least 50 yards and one TD, the longest such streak by a Bear since Gale Sayers had six in a row in 1969.
Fields also threw a 56-yard pass to St. Brown that set up a 7-yard TD run by David Montgomery that made it 16-3 in the second quarter. Fields was 20 of 25 for 254 yards but threw two interceptions.
St. Brown caught three passes for 85 yards, and Cole Kmet added 72 yards receiving.
The Bears led 19-10 with 1:50 left in the third after Santos kicked a 28-yard field goal. The Packers pulled within two in the opening minute of the fourth on a 21-yard run by Dillon to cap a four-play, 82-yard drive aided by a pass-interference penalty against Jaylon Jones.
Crosby nailed a 32-yarder to give the Packers a 20-19 lead with 4:49 remaining after Rodgers failed to squeeze a 14-yard pass to Robert Tonyan in the end zone.
