Jamaal Williams ran for his 14th touchdown early in the first quarter to help the Lions get off to a strong start and they did not slow down in a 40-14 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
The Jaguars (4-8) had a scare on the last play of the second quarter when quarterback Trevor Lawrence was sacked and grabbed his left knee, but their defense made his return moot.
Lawrence, coming off the best performance of his two-year career, was 17 of 31 for 179 yards with a touchdown for an offense that was just 3 of 12 on third down. He was taken out late in the fourth quarter with his team trailing by 26 points.
Goff, meanwhile, had one of his best games by completing 31 of 41 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns.
Amon-Ra St. Brown had 11 receptions for 114 yards and two touchdowns while Williams and D'Andre Swift combined for 97 yards rushing and two scores for the Lions.
Jacksonville's Travis Etienne, who was limited to 54 yards rushing, lost a fumble early in the game and Williams scored on a 1-yard touchdown run seven snaps later.
 said receiver DJ Chark, who set season highs with five catches for 98 yards against his former team.
Lions rookie receiver Jameson Williams played for the first time since suiting up for Alabama in college football's championship game and injuring his left knee. Williams, drafted No. 12 overall, drew a roar from the crowd when he jogged on the field for Detroit's second snap and again late in the first half.
Goff threw a pass to Williams late in the third quarter that fell incomplete and the crowd wanted more, chanting,  in the fourth.
Jacksonville linebacker Travon Walker, the No. 1 pick overall, had five tackles. Detroit defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, selected second overall, had two tackles and was credited with half a sack to give him a total of six this season.
