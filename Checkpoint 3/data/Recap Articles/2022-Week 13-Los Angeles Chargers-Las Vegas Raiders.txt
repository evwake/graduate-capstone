Carr had no trouble smiling Sunday following the Raiders' 27-20 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.
 Carr said after passing for 250 yards and two touchdowns against Los Angeles. 
The loss was a significant setback for the Chargers (6-6), who are just outside the playoff picture.
Carr completed a 31-yarder to Adams for the first touchdown 32 seconds into the third quarter. Less than four minutes later, the duo hooked up on a 45-yard flea flicker for another score.
Adams caught eight passes for 177 yards, surpassing 1,000 yards for the fourth time since 2018. He also has 85 career touchdown catches, moving past Calvin Johnson for fifth most for a receiver in his first nine seasons.
 Adams said. “I'm doing what I've got to do. The efficiency part of it is big, too. We've got to make sure we're being as efficient as possible and let the stats and of all that take care of themselves down the road.
Josh Jacobs rushed for 144 yards and a touchdown, and the Raiders improved to 5-1 this season when has 100 or more yards. For the season, Jacobs has 1,303 yards, the most in Raiders history through 12 games.
 Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said. “They’re the reason for that. They come through over and over again in critical situations.
That combination on offense backed an aggressive defense that sacked Justin Herbert five times and split their season series with the Chargers.
Chandler Jones entered with just a half-sack, but the defensive end recorded three in the first half alone. He also tackled Herbert a yard short of the first down on a fourth-and-2 in the first quarter.
Herbert completed 28 of 47 passes for 335 yards for this 20th career 300-yard game.
Herbert nearly rallied the Chargers from a 14-point deficit. On fourth-and-10, he rolled right and fired a 35-yard touchdown pass to Keenan Allen with 8:34 left to bring Los Angeles to within 27-20. It was Allen's 50th career TD reception.
Allen, who caught six passes for 88 yards, missed the last seven games with a hamstring injury.
