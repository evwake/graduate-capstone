Pittsburgh trailed 13-9 and needed to go 80 yards to reach the end zone against a team that hadn't allowed a touchdown at home since before Halloween.

Pickett scrambled away from pressure, and the rookie threw a perfect pass to Harris, who had slipped behind linebacker Roquan Smith along the left sideline.
The playoff-bound Ravens (10-6) now need Buffalo to beat Cincinnati on Monday to keep their hopes of winning the AFC North alive. Baltimore allowed a touchdown at home for the first time in four games, and it was a costly one.
Tyler Huntley threw a scoring pass to Isaiah Likely late in the first half for the game's only other touchdown.
A penalty on Pittsburgh's Cam Heyward led to the game's first touchdown. With the score tied at 3 late in the second quarter, the Steelers stopped Baltimore on third down, but Heyward was called for unnecessary roughness while on top of the pile. Instead of settling for a field goal, the Ravens had a new set of downs at the Pittsburgh 7 with 11 seconds left.
The Ravens are 2-2 without quarterback Lamar Jackson, who was sidelined again with a knee injury. The passing game looked sharper Sunday than in some of Huntley's previous action, but he was intercepted at the end of the game after the Steelers took the lead.
