JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- — Dameon Pierce initially got hit behind the line of scrimmage. He slipped Rayshawn Jenkins' tackle and then six or seven more on his way to a 20-yard gain that was more impressive than the rookie's 75-yard touchdown run a week earlier.
Pierce ran for 99 yards and a touchdown, a score set up by his determined fourth-quarter scamper through half of Jacksonville's defense, and the Texans beat the Jaguars 13-6 on Sunday to extend their winning streak in the series to nine.
Houston (1-3-1) picked up its first win of the season — first under coach Lovie Smith — and fifth straight in Jacksonville despite finishing with 248 yards. The Jaguars (2-3) managed 422 yards but had a turnover and two field goals in three trips inside the 20-yard line.
The Texans got a huge assist from the top pick in April’s NFL draft. Jaguars linebacker Travon Walker slung quarterback Davis Mills to the ground after whistles stopped a third-and-20 play. Walker was going to be flagged for a neutral-zone infraction and penalized 5 yards. But his inexcusable mistake gave Houston 15 yards and an automatic first down.
Pierce even escaped Smoot's grasp before Campbell and Cisco finally brought him down just shy of the goal line. Pierce scored up the middle two plays later, putting the Texans up 13-6 in an otherwise ugly game that up to that point featured four field goals, eight punts and 10 penalties.
Jacksonville's second-year starter, coming off a five-turnover game at Philadelphia, completed 25 of 47 passes for 286 yards and two interceptions. Rookie rookie Derek Stingley Jr. picked off Lawrence's pass in the end zone to end the opening drive of the second half — a huge turning point in the game.
