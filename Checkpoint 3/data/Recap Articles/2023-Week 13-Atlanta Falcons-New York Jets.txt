EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- — The rain was falling, penalty flags were flying and the Atlanta Falcons kept slogging away.
Desmond Ridder threw a 20-yard pass to MyCole Pruitt in the second quarter for the game's only touchdown and the Falcons took over sole possession of first place in the NFC South with an ugly 13-8 victory over the punchless New York Jets on a dreary Sunday.
The Falcons (6-6) have back-to-back victories for the first time since opening the season with wins over Carolina and Green Bay. Atlanta entered tied atop the division with New Orleans, which lost to Detroit.
And this game appealed only to fans of sloppy play, punting and penalty flags.
The Jets (4-8) got an early safety but couldn't get anything going — again — on offense in losing their fifth straight game. New York even pulled quarterback Tim Boyle and replaced him with Trevor Siemian in the fourth quarter to try to provide a spark, but it was more of the same misery in what appeared a half-filled MetLife Stadium.
Siemian and the Jets had a chance to win with 1:53 left but again were ineffective other than a 25-yard completion to Xavier Gipson.
The loss for New York, which had three turnovers, is a serious hit to the Jets' playoff hopes — as well as the possibility of a return by Aaron Rodgers, who has said his potential comeback this season was contingent on the team remaining in the postseason hunt.
Ridder finished 12 of 27 for 121 yards and the touchdown to Pruitt. Bijan Robinson ran for 53 yards on 18 carries and had three catches for 26 yards.
The Falcons took advantage of a short field after Dee Alford recovered Dalvin Cook's fumble in the second quarter. Ridder capped a six-play, 47-yard drive by connecting with a diving Pruitt for a 7-2 lead.
Greg Zuerlein cut the Jets' deficit to 7-5 with 3:56 remaining before halftime with a 27-yard field goal.
Younghoe Koo's 22-yarder as time expired in the half made it 10-5 on a drive that was helped by Jets penalties. First was a personal foul on Chazz Surratt for illegal use of the helmet on the kickoff, putting Atlanta in New York territory. Later came a pass interference call on Quincy Williams and an unnecessary roughness call on D.J. Reed in the end zone.
The Jets had eight penalties in the first half — four in the last 1:55 — for 56 yards, compared to just two calls on the Falcons.
New York finished with 11 penalties for 71 yards, while Atlanta was penalized six times for 55 yards.
Boyle finished 14 of 25 for 148 yards and the INT. Siemian was 5 of 13 for 66 yards and lost one of his three fumbles.
