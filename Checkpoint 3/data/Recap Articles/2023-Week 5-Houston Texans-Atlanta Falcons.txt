Now Ridder has a last-second comeback win as an impressive answer to his critics.
Ridder passed and ran for touchdowns, providing a response to those who had called for him to be benched, Younghoe Koo kicked a go-ahead 37-yard field goal as time expired, and the Falcons snapped a two-game skid by beating the Houston Texans 21-19 on Sunday.
After Houston took a 19-18 lead with 1:49 remaining, Ridder completed each of his five passes on the final drive to set up Koo's game-ending kick. The Falcons (3-2) stopped a two-game skid.
It was a strong comeback for Ridder following his three turnovers, including a pick-6, in last week’s 23-7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.
Ridder had no turnovers against the Texans. His bounce-back performance ended a two-game winning streak for Houston (2-3).
The key play in the game-winning drive was Ridder's 23-yard completion to Drake London to the Houston 26 that Smith said 
Ridder's 6-yard TD pass to rookie running back Bijan Robinson and 2-point pass to Tyler Allgeier gave the Falcons a 15-12 lead early in the fourth quarter. Robinson reached back to catch the shovel pass against his hip before running through the middle of the Houston defense into the end zone.
Houston rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud answered with an 18-yard scoring pass to tight end Dalton Schultz, giving the Texans a 19-18 lead with 1:49 remaining. Schultz found an opening in the middle of the end zone behind safety Jessie Bates.
Stroud set an NFL record by starting his career with 177 pass attempts without an interception. He broke the record previously held by Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott. Stroud set the NFL record for rookies a week earlier when he reached 151 attempts without an interception.
Stroud completed 20 of 35 passes for 249 yards and a score.
Ridder completed 28 of 37 passes for a career-high 329 yards and a touchdown. He had a 7-yard scoring run in the first quarter.
Before Stroud's scoring pass to Schultz, the Texans had to settle for four field goals by Kaʻimi Fairbairn, including a 28-yarder with 3 seconds remaining in the first half for a 9-7 lead.
The Falcons overcame two third-quarter turnovers by Robinson and Jonnu Smith. The Texans were held to one field goal from the two takeaways.
London matched his season high with six catches and set a high with 78 receiving yards while tight end Kyle Pitts set high marks for the year with seven catches for 87 yards. Just as there had been increased criticism of Ridder, the Falcons also had faced questions about failing to utilize Pitts and London, their first-round draft picks in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
