Still, it was quite the assist — again — from cornerback DaRon Bland.
Prescott threw two of his four touchdown passes to CeeDee Lamb, Bland recorded his NFL-leading third interception return for a score and the Dallas Cowboys beat the Los Angeles Rams 43-20 on Sunday.
Sam Williams blocked a punt for a safety before KaVontae Turpin returned the ensuing punt 63 yards to set up Lamb’s first TD grab, helping the Cowboys (5-2) to a 33-3 lead late in the first half in their 11th consecutive home victory.
It was a rough-and-tumble homecoming for Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who was replaced by Brett Rypien late in the third quarter after injuring a thumb on a failed 2-point conversion pass and aggravating the injury after catching another.
With the Cowboys sending six pass rushers at him, Stafford threw behind Cooper Kupp to a waiting Bland for an easy 30-yard return and a 17-3 Dallas lead in the first quarter.
Bland brought an interception back 22 yards for a score against the New York Giants in the opener before a 54-yarder in Week 4 against the Patriots.
Despite getting sacked three times in the first quarter — with a fourth wiped out by a defensive penalty — Prescott finished the first half 17 of 21 for 225 yards. He ended up with his first 300-yard game of the season (25 of 31 for 304 yards with an interception).
This time, Prescott became the leader of a storied franchise with his seventh game of at least 300 yards and four touchdowns passing.
Lamb had career highs with 12 catches for 158 yards, including another personal best with 122 yards before the break.
Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey tied an NFL record with two field goals, giving him 18 consecutive makes to start his career. Travis Coons made his first 18 with Cleveland in 2015.
Rams receiver Puka Nacua had three catches to set a league record for the most catches through the first eight games of a career with 61. But he fell short of the 51 yards needed to set that mark as well, finishing with 43.
The Cowboys inducted franchise career sacks leader DeMarcus Ware into the team’s ring of honor at halftime. Ware was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame this past summer. The 41-year-old is the 23rd member of the ring of honor.
Ware had 117 of his 138 1/2 career sacks in nine years with the Cowboys before going to Denver and winning a Super Bowl after he was released in a cost-cutting move. Ware’s 20 sacks in 2008 were the most in a single season in franchise history since sacks became an official stat in 1982.
