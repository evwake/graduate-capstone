Carr masterfully carved up Indianapolis' young, depleted secondary, Taysom Hill and Alvin Kamara scored two touchdowns apiece, and the Saints beat the Colts 38-27 to move into a share of the NFC South lead.
New Orleans (4-4) ended a two-game skid, and Carr got a chance to move past the criticism he took for scolding teammates and yelling at offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael during a Week 7 loss to Jacksonville.
Things went smoothly against the Colts (3-5). Carr made all the right reads, was on time and watched his receivers take care of the rest.
The four-time Pro Bowler went 19 of 27 for 310 yards with two TDs and no interceptions. Although he lost a fumble, he made big play after big play.
Rashid Shaheed had three catches for a career-best 153 yards, including a 58-yard TD catch, and for the second time this year he helped seal the victory with a long third-down reception in the final minutes. Kamara also caught a TD pass while Michael Thomas and Chris Olave combined for nine receptions and 114 yards.
Gardner Minshew was 23 of 41 for 213 yards with two TDs and one interception. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 87 of his 95 yards in the first quarter while Zack Moss finished with 66 yards and scored on a 1-yard stretch across the goal line.
But Indy's pass coverage was no match for Carr.
Carr opened the Saints' scoring with an 18-yard TD pass to Kamara before hooking up with Shaheed as New Orleans took a 21-20 halftime lead.
Kamara's 25-yard reception late in the third quarter set up his powerful 16-yard scoring run that made it 28-20. And when Shaheed was awarded a 44-yard catch after a replay review of an apparent interception, Hill capped the drive with a 1-yard scoring run to make it 35-20 with 10:49 to play.
Minshew answered with a 33-yard TD pass to Drew Ogletree with 8:19 left that got the Colts within 35-27. But after a defensive stop, Minshew couldn't drive Indy for a potential tying score, and the Saints closed it out with a short field goal.
Saints: While DE Carl Granderson left briefly in the third quarter with an undisclosed injury and LG James Hurst (ankle) was inactive, the Saints were impacted more by the illness running through the locker room. At least four players could be seen using IVs following the game. Tight end Jimmy Graham did not play because of an illness.
Colts: Minshew appeared to hurt his left ankle in the first quarter but did not miss a snap. LB Zaire Franklin, the NFL's top tackler, went to the locker after appearing to hurt his right knee in the first but also returned. RT Braden Smith (hip and wrist), CB JuJu Brents (quad), TE Kylen Granson (concussion protocol), DE Eric Johnson II (ankle) and DT Grover Stewart (suspension) all sat out.
